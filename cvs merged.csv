"Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 1 August 2022 – 31 January 2023   |   1 I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY "
 
1. This thirty-fifth report by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on the 
human rights situation in Ukraine covers the period from 1 August 2022 to 31 January 2023. It is 
based on the work of the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU).1  
2. The human rights situation across the country remains dire amid the ongoing armed attack by the 
Russian Federation against Ukraine. The international armed conflict has led to a wide range of 
human rights violations affecting both civilians and combatants. OHCHR has verified numerous 
"allegations of arbitrary deprivation of life, arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance, torture "
"and ill-treatment, and conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV). "
"3. During the reporting period, OHCHR recorded a total of 5,987 civilian casualties, with 1,605 "
"persons killed and 4,382 persons injured. However, actual casualty numbers are likely considerably "
"higher, since these figures only include the cases that OHCHR has been able to verify. A large "
number of civilian casualties resulted from attacks where explosive weapons with wide area effects 
"were used. The war has taken a heavy toll on civilians, with acts of hostilities killing groups of "
individuals and in some cases multiple members of the same families at once.  
"4. Since October 2022, Russian strikes targeting critical energy infrastructure have killed at least 116 "
"civilians and injured at least 379. They have resulted in serious shortages of electricity, affecting the "
"population’s capacity to face the winter. Moreover, the hostilities have severely impacted civilian "
infrastructure and housing. OHCHR recorded damage or destruction to 107 medical facilities and 
179 educational facilities during the reporting period. The damage to and destruction of civilian 
"infrastructure have also infringed on the enjoyment of other human rights, including the rights to "
"security, health, work, education, housing, social support and services for persons with disabilities, "
and freedom of religion or belief. 
"5. During the reporting period, OHCHR documented the killings of 21 civilians by Russian armed "
"forces,2 both through summary executions and attacks on individual civilians. It also documented "
"214 cases (185 men, 24 women and 5 boys) of enforced disappearances and arbitrary detentions "
of civilians in territory of Ukraine that was or remains under the occupation of the Russian Federation. 
"Russian armed forces arrested victims in their homes, workplaces, in the street, or at checkpoints "
"during so-called ‘filtration’ processes. OHCHR documented 10 cases (7 men, 3 women) of enforced "
disappearances and arbitrary detentions of media workers and human rights defenders in territory 
occupied by the Russian Federation. 
"6. OHCHR is gravely concerned about the arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance and torture or "
"other ill-treatment of children. During the reporting period, OHCHR documented the enforced "
disappearances of five boys between 14 and 17 years old by Russian armed forces. The children 
                                                
"1 HRMMU was deployed on 14 March 2014 to monitor and report on the human rights situation throughout Ukraine, "
"with particular attention to the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, eastern and southern regions of Ukraine, and to "
propose recommendations to the Government and other actors to address human rights concerns. For more 
"information, see A/HRC/27/75, paras. 7-8. "
"2 OHCHR refers to Russian armed forces as comprising all actors fighting on behalf of the Russian Federation, including "
"the Armed Forces and National Guard Forces of the Russian Federation, as well as affiliated armed groups of the "
"former self-proclaimed ‘republics’ and Wagner Group military and security contractors. In the same way, OHCHR "
refers to Russian prisoners of war (POWs) in relation to all individuals from the above-mentioned forces that fell into 
"the hands of the belligerent party, regardless of their nationality. "
 
"Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 1 August 2022 – 31 January 2023   |   2 were all subjected to torture or other ill-treatment, and, in one case, the victim was deported to "
Belarus. 
"7. From February 2022 to 31 January 2023, OHCHR documented 133 cases of CRSV (85 men, 45 "
"women, 3 girls), the majority of which took place in territory occupied by the Russian Federation. "
109 cases are attributable to Russian armed forces or Russian law enforcement and penitentiary 
"staff. Sexual violence frequently occurred in a context of deprivation of liberty, as well as in "
residential areas of villages. It also took place during so-called ‘filtration’ processes by Russian armed 
"forces. During the reporting period, OHCHR documented three cases of rape against women in "
small communities where Russian armed forces were stationed.  
"8. OHCHR documented transfers of civilians to areas in occupied territory or to the Russian Federation, "
some of which may amount to forced transfers or deportations. These transfers include children and 
"adults who lived in institutionalised settings and unaccompanied children from parts of Donetsk, "
"Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Odesa and Zaporizhzhia regions while they were occupied by the Russian "
Federation or temporarily controlled by Russian armed forces.  
9. OHCHR documented that freedom of movement restrictions imposed by the occupying authorities 
"have jeopardised access to social security and health care. Residents of Kharkiv, Kherson and "
Zaporizhzhia regions were left with little or no cash to provide for their means of subsistence. In 
"areas of Kherson which were occupied by the Russian Federation until November, checkpoints "
established by Russian armed forces prevented civilians from leaving their villages from March to 
"the end of the occupation, thereby severely undermining their access to medical assistance. "
"10. In the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, Ukraine (Crimea), occupied by "
"the Russian Federation,3 the occupying authorities continued to prosecute individuals on the grounds "
of “public actions directed at discrediting” and “obstructing” the Russian armed forces. By 31 
"January 2023, OHCHR had documented 210 prosecutions since the introduction of these "
punishable offenses in 2022. There was a progressive increase in convictions throughout 2022.  
"11. In territory of Ukraine under control of the Government of Ukraine, OHCHR documented 91 cases "
"of enforced disappearances and arbitrary detentions (79 men, 12 women) committed by Ukrainian "
armed forces4 and law enforcement agencies. Most detainees were arrested for suspicion of 
"collaborating with, or other forms of aiding, Russian armed forces. OHCHR interviewed 8 individuals "
"(3 men and 5 women) prosecuted for the crime of “collaboration activity”, several of whom reported "
"being beaten during their arrest or following their transfer to places of detention, held "
"incommunicado in unofficial places of detention, denied access to legal aid and subjected to torture "
and ill-treatment during interrogations. OHCHR also documented the arbitrary detention of 88 
"Russian civilian sailors who legally entered Ukraine before 24 February 2022, but were not "
"thereafter allowed to disembark from their ships in Izmail, Odesa region. One sailor died from a "
chronic condition due to the lack of adequate medical care. 
"12. In a welcome development, on 1 December, the Parliament of Ukraine adopted a law in order to "
"align national criminal legislation with the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or "
                                                
"3 See General Assembly resolutions 68/262, 71/205, 72/190, 73/194, 73/263, 74/17, 74/168, 75/29, "
"75/192, 76/179 and 77/229. "
"4 OHCHR refers to Ukrainian armed forces as comprising all actors fighting on behalf of Ukraine, namely the Armed "
"Forces of Ukraine (including units of the Territorial Defense), National Guard of Ukraine and State Border Guard "
"Service of Ukraine, both under the authority of the Ministry of Interior, some units of the Security Service of Ukraine "
"(SBU), National Police and other law-enforcement agencies directly engaged in hostilities, as well as members of "
organized resistance movements. OHCHR refers to Ukrainian POWs in relation to all individuals from the above-
"mentioned forces that fell in the hands of the belligerent party, regardless of their nationality. "
 
"Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 1 August 2022 – 31 January 2023   |   3 Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The law notably brings the domestic definition of “torture” in "
line with the Convention. 
"13. Since 24 February 2022, OHCHR has documented 24 cases of CRSV in territory controlled by the "
Government of Ukraine. All cases occurred between March and July 2022. They mostly affected 
men and consisted predominantly of threats of sexual violence during the initial stages of detention 
"by Ukrainian law enforcement officers, and of forced public stripping of alleged lawbreakers by "
civilians or members of territorial defence forces. 
14. OHCHR notes the efforts of the Government of Ukraine to integrate a victim-centred approach into 
CRSV investigations and to provide assistance to survivors. It also welcomes the Government’s 
ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against 
"Women and Domestic Violence (Istanbul Convention), which entered into force on 1 November.  "
15. OHCHR also welcomes the Government’s decision to maintain and continue to pay pensions in all 
"areas of Ukraine, including to those who were registered as IDPs before 24 February 2022. OHCHR "
"notes, however, that social assistance for those in need remains frequently inadequate. OHCHR "
"continues to document inadequate housing in conflict-affected areas, where many people’s homes "
have been damaged or destroyed.  
"16. OHCHR documented searches conducted by the SBU as “security measures” in several monasteries, "
"offices, education facilities and other property of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC). OHCHR "
is concerned that official actions targeting the UOC could be discriminatory. OHCHR also recalls 
the necessity of ensuring that all those facing criminal charges enjoy the full spectrum of non-
derogable fair trial rights. 
17. OHCHR continues to monitor the prosecution of war crimes in Ukraine. While welcoming the 
substantial efforts of the Government of Ukraine to prosecute war crimes and uphold the right of 
"victims to truth and effective remedies, OHCHR has concerns regarding the overall fairness of certain "
"proceedings. In particular, 12 perpetrators were convicted and sentenced in absentia , which in "
some circumstances may be contrary to the right to be present during one’s trial. 
  
 
"Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 1 August 2022 – 31 January 2023   |   4 II. METHODOLOGY "
"18. The report is based on information gathered during 99 field visits, 32 visits to places of detention, "
"and 1,090 interviews with victims and witnesses of human rights violations, as well as with relatives "
"of victims and their lawyers, Government representatives, members of civil society and other "
"interlocutors.5 It also draws from information obtained from court proceedings, official records, open "
sources and other relevant material. Findings are based on verified information collected from 
primary and secondary sources that are assessed as credible and reliable. They are included in the 
"report where the “reasonable grounds to believe” standard of proof is met, namely where, based "
"on a body of verified information, an ordinarily prudent observer would have reasonable grounds "
to believe that the facts took place as described. Legal conclusions are drawn when there are 
reasonable grounds to conclude that the facts meet all the elements of a violation. While OHCHR 
"cannot provide an exhaustive account of all human rights violations committed throughout Ukraine, "
it obtains and verifies information through a variety of means in line with its established methodology 
and bases its conclusions on verified cases.  
 
19. OHCHR applies the same standard of proof when documenting conflict-related civilian casualties.6 
"In some instances, it may take time before conclusions can be drawn, meaning that the numbers of "
civilian casualties are revised as more information becomes available. OHCHR applies the 
“reasonable grounds to believe” standard in attributing a civilian casualty to a particular party. It 
"should be noted that the verification process is based on a factual determination, and that not all "
civilian casualties are necessarily deaths or injuries in violation of international humanitarian law 
(IHL). 
"20. While some violations covered in this report may have taken place prior to the reporting period, all "
information in this report was verified and documented during the reporting period 
                                                
5 With 672 men and 418 women interviewed.

"Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 1 August 2022 – 31 January 2023   |   6 III. IMPACT OF HOSTILITIES ON THE CIVILIAN "
POPULATION 
A. CIVILIAN CASUALTIES 
Civilian casualties during the reporting period 
"23. From 1 August 2022 to 31 January 2023, OHCHR recorded 5,987 civilian casualties in the country. "
They included: 
"- 1,605 persons killed (631 men, 388 women, 43 boys and 25 girls, as well as 516 adults "
and 2 children whose sex is not yet known). 
"- 4,382 persons injured (1,140 men, 780 women, 115 boys and 82 girls, as well as 2,191 "
adults and 74 children whose sex is not yet known). 
"24. This is a 60 per cent decrease compared with the preceding six months, during which 15,032 "
"casualties were recorded, with 6,340 persons killed and 8,692 injured. "
 
"25. During the reporting period, civilian casualties were documented as follows: "
"- 4,796 [1,220 civilians killed (401 men, 270 women, 31 boys and 15 girls, as well as 501 "
"adults and 2 children whose sex is not yet known) and 3,576 injured (735 men, 449 women, "
"91 boys and 63 girls, as well as 2,171 adults and 67 children whose sex is not yet known)] "
were recorded in 334 settlements in areas under Government control when the casualties 
"occurred, constituting 80.1% of civilian casualties recorded in the reporting period. "
"- 1,191 [385 civilians killed (230 men, 118 women, 12 boys and 10 girls, as well as 15 "
"adults whose sex is not yet known) and 806 injured (405 men, 331 women, 24 boys and "
"19 girls, as well as 20 adults and 7 children whose sex is not yet known)] were recorded in "
93 settlements in areas under territory occupied by the Russian Federation when casualties 
"occurred, constituting 19.9% of civilian casualties recorded in the reporting period. "
""
 
"Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 1 August 2022 – 31 January 2023   |   7 26. OHCHR notes that the actual figures are likely considerably higher. Many reports of civilian "
"casualties are still pending corroboration by OHCHR, notably those from Mariupol (Donetsk region), "
"and Lysychansk, Popasna and Sievierodonetsk (Luhansk region). "
27. The vast majority of civilian casualties 
"(1,459 persons killed and 4,112 "
"injured, or 93 per cent) were caused "
by the use of explosive weapons with 
"wide area effects, including shelling "
"from heavy artillery, multiple launch "
"rocket system (MLRS), missiles and air "
"strikes, in populated areas. 99 "
civilians were killed and 256 injured 
as a result of explosive remnants of 
war (ERW) and mine-related 
incidents (6 per cent).7 Another 47 civilians were killed and 14 injured (1 per cent) by fire from 
"small arms and light weapons (SALW), including as a result of crossfire and sniper fire. "
 
"28. In several cases, the use of explosive "
weapons with wide area effects caused multiple 
"civilian casualties. For example, on 22 September, "
mortar shells hit the district of Voroshulovskyi in the 
"Russian-occupied city of Donetsk, killing three women, "
"two men and one boy.  On 30 September, a missile "
"killed 32 people (15 women, 11 men, 1 boy, 1 girl, "
and 4 adults whose sex is not yet known) and injured 
"90 (28 men, 11 women, 1 girl, and 50 adults whose "
sex is not yet known) who were queuing in 
Government-controlled parts of Zaporizhzhia region to 
"cross to Russian-occupied territory. On 20 October, a "
"MLRS rocket hit the village of Chervonyi Prapor /Stare, "
"in Russian-occupied areas of Luhansk region,  killing 7 "
"men, including 6 emergency workers. On 14 January, "
"a missile hit a residential building in Dnipro, killing 45 "
"persons (15 women, 10 men, 4 girls, 3 boys, and 13 "
adults whose sex is not yet known) and injuring 80 (15 
"women, 9 men, 5 girls, 4 boys, as well as 39 adults "
and 8 children whose sex is not yet known). 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                
"7 These incidents involve civilians who were killed or injured by mines (antipersonnel or anti-vehicle), other explosive "
"devices such as booby traps, or unexploded ordnance which inadvertently detonated when touched. "
""
 
"Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 1 August 2022 – 31 January 2023   |   8 Explosive weapons with wide area effects claimed lives of multiple family members  "
"29. The war has taken a heavy toll on civilians, with the hostilities in some cases killing multiple "
"family members at once. From 1 August 2022 to 31 January 2023, OHCHR recorded 17 such "
"incidents involving explosive weapons with wide area effects, where at least one family "
"member was killed and at least one more injured. For example, on 24 August, a missile attack "
"killed a couple in Chaplyne, Dnipropetrovsk region, and left their 17-year-old daughter injured "
"and orphaned. On 25 August, mortar shelling in Horlivka, in Russian-occupied parts of Donetsk "
"region, killed a woman and injured her two children, a boy and a girl. On 29 September, a "
"missile hit a residential building in Dnipro, killing an 8-year-old boy, his 9-year-old sister, and "
"their mother and grandmother. On 6 October, a missile that hit a residential building in "
"Zaporizhzhia killed a young woman, her 10-year-old brother, and their parents. In Krivi Rih, "
"Dnipropetrovsk region, a missile attack on 16 December killed a toddler and his parents, "
"leaving his older brother, who was with his grandmother at the time of the attack, an orphan. "
"On 5 January, shelling in Beryslav, in the Government-controlled part of Kherson region, killed "
"a 12-year-old boy and his parents. On 14 January, no less than six families lost at least two of "
their members in the missile attack that killed 45 persons in Dnipro. 
  
"30. The hostilities have also impacted journalists and media workers, with seven (five men and two "
women) injured during the reporting period. This brings to 22 the total number of injured journalists 
documented by OHCHR since the beginning of the armed attack. Five of these casualties resulted 
"from indiscriminate shelling, while the full circumstances of the other two incidents are still being "
verified. All victims were on assignment when they were injured. Shelling killed one media worker 
in areas of Kherson region that were occupied by the Russian Federation at the time of the incident 
on 20 October 2022. This brings to 18 (14 men and 4 women) the total number of lethal incidents 
documented by OHCHR since 24 February 2022. 
Mine-related incidents and explosive remnants of war 
"31. During the reporting period, mines and ERW continued to kill and injure civilians and to seriously "
"limit their freedom of movement, economic opportunities and access to basic services, including "
"education and healthcare. OHCHR recorded 355 civilian casualties caused by mines and ERW, "
"with 99 persons killed (82 men, 11 women, 4 boys, and 2 girls) and 256 injured (175 men, 32 "
"women, 18 boys, as well as 22 adults and 9 children whose sex is not yet known). Men and boys "
"represent 86 per cent of these casualties, which comprise 6 per cent of all civilian casualties recorded "
"by OHCHR during that period. For example, on 15 August 2022, PFM-1 mines killed a woman and "
"injured a man in the city of Donetsk occupied by the Russian Federation.8 On 8 November, two men "
working for a road maintenance company were killed and two others heavily injured near 
Government-controlled Chkalovske (Kharkiv region) as a result of an anti-tank mine explosion on the 
road they were repairing. The number of civilian victims of mines and ERW is expected to rise 
"considerably in 2023 as the level of contamination of Ukraine, which was already among the "
                                                
"8 PFM-1 mines, also known as butterfly mines, are Russian or Soviet made high explosive anti-personnel land mines. "
"OHCHR is following up on all reported cases of the use of PFM-1 mines in Ukraine, both in Government-controlled "
"territory and in territory occupied by the Russian Federation. In 2022, the number of such reports significantly "
"increased, reaching their peak in August. The use of PFM-1 mines, especially when they are planted in populated "
"areas, may amount to an indiscriminate attack on civilians and therefore an IHL violation. "
 
"Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 1 August 2022 – 31 January 2023   |   9 highest in the world from 2014 to 2021, dramatically increased in 2022 and on current trajectory "
will likely continue to increase in 2023. 
32. OHCHR stresses that the use of anti-personnel mines does not comply with the IHL principle of 
"distinction, as they are inherently indiscriminate,9 nor with the prohibition to employ weapons and "
methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering.10 Ukraine has 
"ratified the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of "
"Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction (Ottawa Convention). Moreover, both Ukraine and "
"the Russian Federation are bound by the Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War, which inter alia  "
"requires parties to an armed conflict, after the cessation of active hostilities and as soon as feasible, "
"to mark and clear, remove or destroy explosive remnants of war in affected territories under their "
control.11 They are also required to take all feasible precautions to protect civilians from the risks 
"and effects of explosive remnants of war, including marking, fencing, monitoring, warnings and risk "
education to the civilian population. 
Civilian casualties during the entire conflict period 
"33. From 14 April 2014 to 31 January 2023, OHCHR recorded a total of 11,052 conflict-related "
"civilian deaths (5,357 men, 3,147 women, 358 boys, 250 girls, and 1,909 adults and 31 children "
whose sex is not yet known). Taking into account the 298 people on board Malaysian Airlines flight 
"MH17, which Russian-affiliated armed groups shot down on 17 July 2014, the total civilian death "
"toll has reached at least 11,350. "
 
                                                
"9 See Additional Protocol I, arts. 48, 51(2) and (4). Parties to a conflict must always distinguish between civilians and "
"combatants. Direct attacks on civilians, indiscriminate attacks and the use of indiscriminate weapons are prohibited. "
"In addition, customary IHL obliges the parties to a conflict to take particular care to minimize the indiscriminate effects "
"of anti-personnel mines, see ICRC CIHL Database, Rules 81-83. "
"10 See Additional Protocol I, art. 35(2). OHCHR notes that the Ottawa Convention bans the use of anti-personnel mines. "
The Russian Federation has not ratified the Ottawa Convention but is bound by the Protocol on Prohibitions or

"Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 1 August 2022 – 31 January 2023   |   10 B. DESTRUCTION OF AND DAMAGE TO CIVILIAN OBJECTS  "
"34. During the reporting period, OHCHR verified widespread destruction of and damage to civilian "
"objects across the country, in particular medical and educational facilities, as well as critical energy "
"infrastructure. Most incidents resulted from explosive weapons with wide area effects, such as heavy "
"artillery, MLRS and cruise missiles. While OHCHR has not been able to assess compliance with IHL "
"for each individual incident, the patterns, scale and frequency of damage and destruction strongly "
indicate that recurring violations of IHL have taken place. 
Medical and educational facilities 
35. OHCHR has serious concerns about the scale and frequency of destruction of medical facilities. 
Some incidents may also amount to a violation of the rules of IHL which afford them a special 
"protection status. During the reporting period, OHCHR documented that military attacks destroyed "
"20 healthcare facilities and damaged 87 more. Actual figures are likely higher. Of them, 57 were "
"attributed to Russian armed forces, 45 to Ukrainian armed forces, and 5 are not yet attributed "
because they occurred in areas of Donetsk and Kharkiv regions that were contested at the time of 
"the attack. These attacks have put both patients and medical staff at risk, and resulted in 30 civilian "
"casualties among staff, patients and their companions, with 8 civilians killed (3 women, 2 men, 1 "
"boy and 2 adults whose sex is not yet known) and 22 injured (9 women, 9 men and 4 adults whose "
sex is not yet known).  
"36. For example, on 3 October, a missile hit a hospital in Government-controlled Kupiansk, Kharkiv "
"region, killing one doctor (man) and injuring two nurses (women). On 23 November, a missile hit a "
"maternity ward in Government-controlled Vilniansk, Zaporizhzhia region, killing a new-born boy "
"and injuring his mother and two doctors. On 28 January, a MLRS strike damaged a hospital in the "
"city of Novoaidar, in the occupied part of Luhansk region. The destruction of medical facilities has "
also restricted access to healthcare and jeopardised the right to health. IHL prescribes that hospitals 
shall be protected at all times during armed conflict and not be objects of attack.12 
"37. During the reporting period, OHCHR documented the destruction of 61 educational facilities and "
damage to 118 of them. Actual figures are likely higher. 96 of the attacks are attributed to Russian 
"armed forces, 66 to Ukrainian armed forces, and 17 attacks are not yet attributed (in areas of "
"Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kherson regions that were contested at the time of the attack). The hostilities and "
their impact on educational facilities have severely disrupted the education of millions of students. 
"38. In total, from 24 February 2022 to 31 January 2023, OHCHR documented the destruction of 38 "
"medical facilities and 156 educational facilities, and the damage of 287 medical facilities and 475 "
educational facilities. 598 cases are attributed to the Russian armed forces and 279 cases to 
Ukrainian armed forces. 79 cases occurred in contested areas and are not yet attributed. The actual 
number of destroyed or damaged medical and educational facilities on both sides of the front line 
                                                
12 Article 19 of the Geneva Convention I for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed 
Forces in the Field; article 18 of the Geneva Convention IV relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of 
"War; article 12 of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the "
Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts; rule 28 of customary IHL. According to article 13(1) of 
"Additional Protocol I, hospitals lose the protection afforded by IHL if they are used to “commit, outside their "
"humanitarian function, acts harmful to the enemy”. However, in such cases, the protection may cease “only after a "
"warning has been given setting, whenever appropriate, a reasonable time-limit, and after such warning has remained "
"unheeded”. Even when hospitals have lost their special protection, the general rules of IHL apply, including the "
principle of proportionality. 
 
"Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 1 August 2022 – 31 January 2023   |   11 is likely considerably higher.13 In addition to the destruction of health facilities, many health "
"professionals have fled conflict-affected areas, making it harder to access a doctor or receive "
specialised services. Many pharmacies have also closed or are not supplied with sufficient 
medication. 
C. STRIKES ON CRITICAL ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE  
"39. On 10 October, Russian armed forces initiated a series of strikes by cruise missiles, ground-to-air "
"missiles (used against ground targets) and loitering munitions targeting critical infrastructure, and in "
"particular energy objects across Ukraine. As of 31 January 2023, they had launched 14 of these "
attacks. OHCHR received credible reports that the attacks damaged or destroyed at least 76 objects 
"of energy infrastructure in 19 regions of Ukraine and Kyiv, mostly cogeneration plants and electricity "
"substations. They also killed at least 116 civilians, injured at least 379, and damaged at least 5 "
"apartment buildings, 70 private houses, 4 cultural facilities, 5 plants and 20 other civilian objects. "
"40. The strikes have caused power, heating, and water supply outages and disrupted mobile and internet "
connectivity and railway traffic across the country. They have put millions of civilians at risk during 
the colder months and disrupted education for millions of children in Ukraine. They have also created 
"new flows of displacement. While temperatures were freezing, the Government of Ukraine had to "
introduce regular power cuts in all regions to enable repair works and mitigate the shortage of 
electricity. Given the adverse impact that the large-scale destruction of critical energy infrastructure 
"has had on the enjoyment of the rights to life, health, education and an adequate standard of living "
"for broad sectors of the civilian population in affected areas, OHCHR is gravely concerned that "
"these strikes do not appear to conform with the rules on the conduct of hostilities, in particular the "
principle of proportionality.14 
  
                                                
13 The Ministry of Healthcare reported that 540 medical facilities had been destroyed or damaged since 24 February 
"2022 (Ukrinform, The healthcare system is confidently holding the medical front , 12 February 2023, "
"www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-society/3668211-viktor-lasko-ministr-ohoroni-zdorova-ukraini.html, last consulted on 10 "
March 2023). The Ministry of Education and Science reported that 441 educational facilities had been destroyed 
"and 3,121 damaged since 24 February 2022 (Official Telegram channel, Sergiy Shkarlet, 21 February 2023, "
"https://t.me/SerhiyShkarlet/2178, last consulted on 10 March 2023).  "
"14 Even if some of the targeted power plants may have been military objectives, or had a dual function in that they "
"served both civilian and military purposes, Russian armed forces must nevertheless fully abide by the principle of "
"proportionality, which prohibits attacks against military objectives which are “expected to cause incidental loss of "
"civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in "
relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated” (article 51(5)(b) of Protocol Additional to the 
"Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts "
"(Protocol I), of 8 June 1977). "
 
"Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 1 August 2022 – 31 January 2023   |   12 IV. HUMAN RIGHTS IN TERRITORY OF UKRAINE "
OCCUPIED BY THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION  
A. APPLICATION OF RUSSIAN LAW IN OCCUPIED TERRITORY 
"41. From 23 to 27 September, Russian occupation authorities in the occupied territory of Donetsk, "
"Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions purported to hold  ‘referenda’ in these regions on "
"becoming part of the Russian Federation. On 30 September, the President of the Russian Federation "
"signed so-called “Treaties on the Accession of the Donetsk People’s Republic, the Lugansk People’s "
"Republic, the Zaporozhye Region and the Kherson Region to the Russian Federation”,15 purportedly "
"annexing and consequentially applying Russian legislation in these occupied territories, in "
"displacement of the existing legal system.16 On 13 October 2022, the United Nations General "
"Assembly, in its resolution ES11/4 on “Territorial integrity of Ukraine: defending the principles of "
"the Charter of the United Nations”, condemned the organization of the so-called ‘referenda’ and the "
"attempted illegal annexation of the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions, and "
declared that the unlawful actions of the Russian Federation have no validity under international law 
and do not form the basis for any alteration of the status of these regions of Ukraine. 
42. The occupation of territory as a result of international armed conflict is a temporary de facto situation 
"which neither affects the legal status of occupied territory, nor deprives the occupied power of "
sovereignty. Annexation of occupied territory in wartime is unlawful and does not deprive protected 
persons of protection under the Geneva Convention IV. IHL provides that the legislation of the 
occupied country shall remain applicable in the occupied territory unless the occupying power is 
"“absolutely prevented” from doing so,17 or unless they constitute a threat to the security of the "
occupying power or an obstacle to the application of the Geneva Convention IV.18 The occupying 
"power may legislate only if it is essential to protect its security and that of its occupying forces, to "
"implement its obligations under international humanitarian and international human rights law, to "
maintain the orderly government of the territory. 
"43. On 19 October, the President of the Russian Federation signed Decree No. 756 imposing martial "
"law in Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions, parts of which are occupied by the "
Russian Federation. The decree provides for a wide range of measures that may be implemented “if 
"required”, including curfews, property seizures, internment, and restrictions on freedom of "
"movement, freedom of association, and activities of political parties and other public associations.  "
These measures restrict a number of human rights guaranteed by IHRL. OHCHR recalls that the States 
"have the obligation to respect and ensure IHRL in all circumstances where they exercise jurisdiction, "
"including in places under their effective control, and must ensure that any restrictions of human rights "
remain compatible with the requirements of applicable international human rights treaties. 
                                                
"15 The Russian Parliament ratified the “Treaties on the Accession” on 3 October 2022. Nevertheless, they took effect "
"from the date of their signature, i.e. on 30 September 2022, according to the reservations made by the “Parties” to "
each “Treaty”.  
16 Article 8 of each “Treaty”.  
"17 Article 43 of the Hague Regulations Concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land, annexed to the Hague "

“I live 300 meters from my office. Over around four

Killings  
"44. During the reporting period, in addition to the cases covered by a thematic report issued on 7 "
"December 2022,19 OHCHR documented the killings of 21 civilians (17 men, 4 women) by Russian "
"armed forces, both through summary executions and attacks on individual civilians: 14 in Kyiv, 5 in "
"Kharkiv, and 2 in Zaporizhzhia regions.  "
"45. In May 2022, members of the Chechen ‘Kadyrovtsy’ unit executed a 70-year-old forensic expert "
"from the morgue of Izium, Kharkiv region. The perpetrators killed the victim with multiple gunshots "
"after he refused to give up his vehicle, which was specifically adapted to cater for his disability. "
"46. Also in Izium, Russian armed forces killed a 36-year-old woman who was last seen entering a Russian "
"military base in the Honcharivka area of town on 2 June 2022. The same day, Russian troops "
delivered the victim’s body to a local morgue. She had a single gunshot wound to her chest. 
"47. In Balakliia, Kharkiv region, OHCHR documented the killing of a 27-year-old nurse who was last "
"seen departing from work on 18 March 2022. Two weeks later, on 1 April, his body was found in "
"the nearby village of Husarivka, bearing marks suggesting torture, including missing fingers. A local "
unit from former self-proclaimed ‘Luhansk people’s republic’ stationed in the area informed the 
relatives of the victim that members of a Russian military unit operating a checkpoint in the nearby 
village of Bairak had abducted him. 
Conflict-related detentions 
"48. During the reporting period, OHCHR documented 214 cases (185 men, 24 women and 5 boys) of "
enforced disappearances20 and arbitrary detentions21 of civilians that occurred in territory of Ukraine 
while under the occupation of the Russian Federation. These cases took place both before and during 
"the reporting period in Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, Mykolaiv and "
                                                
"19 See OHCHR, Killings of civilians: summary executions and attacks on individual civilians in Kyiv, Chernihiv, and "

"20 In such cases detainees were held incommunicado, including in makeshift places of detention, and their relatives "
had no information about their fate and whereabouts during some or the entire period of detention. Although the 
Russian Federation has not ratified the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
"Disappearance, the prohibition on enforced disappearances constitutes customary IHL and is therefore binding on "
"all states. See Rule 98, ICRC Database on Customary IHL. Furthermore, the Human Rights Committee has noted that "
enforced disappearances result in a violation of the right to life and other rights under the International Covenant on 
"Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR): General Comment no. 36, para. 58.  "
"21 IHRL and IHL both prohibit the arbitrary deprivation of liberty, see ICCPR art. 9 (1); ICRC Customary IHL Study, Rule "
"9; Human Rights Committee, General Comment no. 35, paras. 12 and 64. The aspects of justified deprivation of "
"liberty are reflected in the article 9 of the ICCPR, ratified by the Russian Federation. On elements that indicate the "
"arbitrariness of arrest and detention, see Human Rights Committee, General Comment No. 35, paras. 10-23. "
 
"Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 1 August 2022 – 31 January 2023   |   14 Zaporizhzhia regions. Russian armed forces and law enforcement agencies arrested individuals in "
"their homes, workplaces, in the street, or at checkpoints during so-called ‘filtration’. They deprived "
"the liberty of civilians with strong pro-Ukrainian views or in possession of Ukrainian state symbols, "
including priests; participants in public rallies against the occupying authorities; public officials; 
former members of the Ukrainian armed forces and law enforcement bodies; and those suspected 
of providing assistance and information to the Ukrainian armed forces. 
"49. Since 24 February 2022, OHCHR has documented a total of 621 cases (544 men, 71 women and "
6 boys) of enforced disappearances and arbitrary detentions of civilians. 296 of the victims (243 
"men, 47 women and six boys) were released after various periods of detention usually lasting for "
"several days or weeks. However, 297 victims remain disappeared or arbitrarily detained, usually "
in formal places of detention in occupied territory of Ukraine and in the Russian Federation.  28 of 
the victims (26 men and 2 women) were found dead with signs of violence on their bodies. 
 
"50. During the reporting period, OHCHR interviewed 89 individuals upon their release from captivity "
and received additional information from relatives about their treatment in detention.22 91 per cent 
"of the individuals (93 per cent of men, 79 per cent of women and 100 per cent of boys) reported "
acts amounting to torture and ill-treatment while deprived of liberty. Members of the Russian armed 
forces and the Security Service of Russia (FSB) reportedly tortured or otherwise ill-treated victims to 
"force them to confess to providing assistance to Ukrainian armed forces, to compel them to cooperate "
with the occupying authorities or to intimidate those with pro-Ukrainian views. Victims stated that 
prison guards punched them; beat them with batons and rifle butts; slashed them with knives; 
"threatened to shoot their hands and legs, mutilate or execute them; deprived them of sleep; exposed "
"them to freezing temperatures, sometimes after pouring water on them; electrocuted them; and "
"subjected them to mock executions or sexual violence, including threats of rape and deliberate "
infliction of force or electrocution on sexual organs.

of Ukraine occupied by the Russian Federation.

"Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 1 August 2022 – 31 January 2023   |   15 Children subjected to arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance "
"51. OHCHR is gravely concerned that children have been subjected to arbitrary detention, "
"enforced disappearance, torture and ill-treatment. During the reporting period, OHCHR "
documented the enforced disappearances of five boys between 14 and 17 years old by 
"Russian armed forces. The boys were all subjected to ill-treatment or torture, and one boy "
was deported to Belarus. 
"52. In September 2022, a 14-year-old boy and his adult uncle were abducted by Russian armed "
forces in Kherson region for the uncle’s alleged involvement in filming military positions and 
"transferring information to Ukrainian armed forces. They were handcuffed, blindfolded and "
"then placed in a hole dug in the ground on the property of a gas station, where they were "
"beaten. Two hours later, they were transferred to an unofficial place of detention in the city "
of Kherson. The boy was separated from his uncle and detained with adult male detainees 
in a shower room for several days. The 12 detainees were provided with inadequate food 
"and potable water, being forced to share five liters of water and stale biscuits. He was "
"interrogated twice, during which time he heard other victims being ill-treated. He was then "
transferred to an archive room. He and his uncle were released ten days later. Throughout 
"their detention, their family members were unable to ascertain their fate and whereabouts. "
 
"53. During the reporting period, OHCHR documented an increased risk of enforced disappearance at "
"the Administrative Boundary Line (ABL) between Crimea and Kherson region, especially for male "
travellers. OHCHR documented that three men and one woman were subjected to enforced 
disappearance at the ABL after Russian armed forces searched their mobile devices for any 
statements or symbols that might be perceived as anti-Russian or pro-Ukrainian. OHCHR documented 
"a similar pattern of enforced disappearance of residents in Kherson, while it was occupied by the "
"Russian Federation, followed by their transfer to and detention in Crimea. "
"54. In one case, a young Crimean Tatar went missing in July after he left his home in Kherson region to "
"reunite with his mother in Crimea. When he did not arrive as planned, the man’s relatives tried to "
find him and learned that he had either been stopped when attempting to cross the ABL or 
apprehended in Kherson region and forcibly transferred to Crimea. The family and a privately hired 
"lawyer made numerous attempts to locate the individual, but received no substantial response from "
the occupation authorities. The man remained disappeared until October when his arrest was 
"registered and criminal charges were brought against him. His relatives learned that, prior to being "
"charged, he had been detained in a pre-trial detention centre in Simferopol, without any formal "
status or clear legal grounds. 
"55. During the Russian occupation of areas of Kherson and Kharkiv regions, over which Ukrainian "
"armed forces regained control during the reporting period, OHCHR documented 177 cases of "
"enforced disappearances and arbitrary detentions (159 men, 17 women and 1 boy). OHCHR also "
documented a pattern of arbitrary detention in unofficial locations and identified 35 places used to 
detain civilians in those areas. These included buildings of law enforcement bodies (often equipped 
with temporary detention cells) and industrial or civilian buildings where Russian armed forces and 
"affiliated armed groups were stationed. For example, OHCHR documented the case of two women "
and one man who were arbitrarily detained by Russian armed forces in the police station of the 
"town of Balakliia, Kharkiv region. Russian armed forces and law enforcement bodies apparently "
apprehended the victims because of their pro-Ukrainian views. The victims reported that they and 
other detainees were tortured and ill-treated. Russian soldiers and FSB officers interrogated the man 
 
"Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 1 August 2022 – 31 January 2023   |   16 three times, during which they severely beat him and electrocuted him with a TA-57 (field military "
telephone also widely known as Tapik) to force him to confess to sharing information with Ukrainian 
armed forces. The two women were not subjected to physical violence but experienced high levels 
"of mental distress because they heard and saw other detainees being tortured, including a woman "
sharing their cell who had signs of torture and told them what had happened to her. All three victims 
were released in mid-August and taken to the front line and forced to move to territory controlled by 
"Ukraine. In Kherson region, OHCHR documented the enforced disappearance of a local public "
official who was arrested by six FSB officers in mid-August and detained in the building of a local 
"court in the town of Bilozerka.23 During his four days of detention, FSB officers beat and electrocuted "
"him every day for up to two hours at a time, accusing him of being “Nazi” because he refused to "
"cooperate with the occupying authorities. On the fifth day, the victim negotiated his release by "
making under duress a promise to cooperate and managed to escape.  
Conflict-related sexual violence  
"56. From 24 February 2022 to 31 January 2023, OHCHR documented 133 cases of CRSV24 (85 men, "
"45 women, 3 girls), 109 of them perpetrated by Russian armed forces, law enforcement authorities "
"or penitentiary staff, either in Russian-occupied territory of Ukraine or in the Russian Federation "
itself.25 Most of the documented cases occurred either in a context of deprivation of liberty or in 
villages and communities that were controlled by Russian armed forces.26 
"57. In the majority of the cases that took place in a context of deprivation of liberty, sexual violence was "
"used as a form of torture or ill-treatment. It consisted of rape, electrocution, burning, tying up and "
"beating of genitals, forced nudity, forcing someone to watch or conduct sexual violence against "
"another person, unjustified cavity or strip searches, homophobic insults and threats of sexual violence "
"towards victims or their loved ones. Sexual violence was directed mostly against men POWs, but "
also against detained civilian men. Sexual violence against women in a context of detention mainly 
consisted of unjustified strip searches or threats of sexual violence.  
58. OHCHR documented a case where a man POW was tortured during an interrogation in a so-called 
‘prosecutor’s office’ in Donetsk in July 2022. The interrogator told guards to take the POW to the 
"toilet, where the guards taped his mouth with duct tape, beat him and tasered him in the genitals. "
"In a separate case from July 2022, penitentiary guards from Russian-affiliated armed groups tortured "
"a POW in the penal colony near Olenivka, including by stripping him and burning his genitalia with "
a lighter. Both of these cases were documented during the reporting period through interviews with 
POWs who were exchanged in September 2022. 
"59. In another case, a woman was subjected to repeated rape while held by the FSB. In the beginning "
"of April 2022, FSB officers repeatedly visited her to ask about the whereabouts of her son, a SBU "
"officer. They offered her to work for them, but she refused and told others that the city would soon "
"be liberated by Ukrainian armed forces. In July, eight armed men who introduced themselves as FSB "
officers entered her house and proceeded to beat and strangle her. They blindfolded her and her 
husband and drove them to their base of operations. They brought her into a shed and her husband 
to a nearby garage. A man who introduced himself as the commander told her: “Tell me how you 
                                                
"23 Before the arrest, FSB and Russian servicemen visited the victim several times to persuade him to cooperate with the "
occupying authorities.  
"24 The precarious security situation in parts of Ukraine, stigma and trauma associated with sexual violence, lack of "
victims’ access to services (including sexual and reproductive health services) and breakdown in referral pathways 
are all factors contributing to the continued underreporting of such cases. 
25 79 cases were documented during the reporting period.  
"26 Cases were documented in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Chernihiv and Zaporizhzhia regions. "
 
"Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 1 August 2022 – 31 January 2023   |   17 love Ukraine now. We’ll beat Ukraine out of you”. He then left, and six men in balaclavas and "
"sports clothes took her to a room which had hammers, tongs, electrical wires, whips and other tools "
"laid out on a table. They undressed her while strangling and beating her, touched her breasts and "
"buttocks, raped her by inserting their fingers into her vagina and pressed themselves against her "
"body. Later that day, seven men, including a commander, yelled at her that they would see how "
"much a Ukrainian she was and threatened to tie her to a pole, rape her again, film the rape and "
"send the video to her son. They undressed her again, beat and kicked her. The commander raped "
"her again. Over the next days, they continued torturing her, including by electrocution. The "
commander raped her on multiple occasions by forcing her to perform oral sex until she agreed to 
cooperate. She said she tried to commit suicide while detained. 
"60. During the reporting period, OHCHR documented three cases of rape against women in small "
communities of Kyiv and Kherson regions where Russian armed forces were stationed. In one case 
"that occurred in Kyiv region in March, three Russian soldiers entered the house of the victim and her "
"husband. One of them took her to a nearby house to “talk”. While reloading his gun, he accused "
"her of assisting the Ukrainian armed forces. He pointed his gun to her head, ordered her to undress "
and threatened to shoot her knee if she did something wrong. He raped her while holding a gun 
next to her knee. She reported seeing other used condoms in the house. Local residents in Kyiv 
"region told OHCHR that they tried to “hide girls and young women” from armed men, who were in "
"some instances drunk, by dressing them in old, baggy clothes and by not allowing them to go out.  "
"61. The contact of civilians, especially women and girls, with armed men more generally continued to "
"pose high risks of sexual violence. For instance, a woman reported that two members of the Russian "
armed forces suggested in crude terms to engage in oral sex with them while they were driving her 
to a checkpoint.  
Treatment of prisoners of war 
"62. During the reporting period, OHCHR interviewed 142 Ukrainian POWs (122 men, 20 women) after "
their release and repatriation or return. The Russian Federation did not grant OHCHR access to 
places of internment despite repeated requests.27 OHCHR documented serious violations of IHL and 
"gross violations IHRL at all stages of captivity, including 14 summary executions, 6 deaths of "
"wounded POWs due to lack of medical attention, torture and ill-treatment of 86 per cent of "
"interviewed POWs, and inhuman conditions of evacuation and internment. Detailed information on "
the treatment of POWs in the hands of the Russian Federation and Ukraine is reflected in a separate 
report published in March 2023.28  
Movements or relocations of civilians 
"63. OHCHR documented cases of transfers of civilians, including children and adults in social care "
"institutions, adults in pre-trial and penitentiary institutions, and unaccompanied children, from the "
"occupied parts of Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Odesa29 and Zaporizhzhia regions into the "

"and deportations due, in part, to the lack of access to Russian-occupied territory of Ukraine and to "
the Russian Federation. 
"64. During the reporting period, OHCHR documented 16 cases where civilians (involving 90 men, 28 "
"boys, 18 girls and 2 women) were transferred without their consent, or the consent of their parents, "
"guardians or other legal representatives, from the occupied parts of Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv "
and Odesa regions to the Russian Federation. Three of those cases involved dozens of civilians. In 
"four other cases, dozens of civilians, including children, being detained by Russian armed forces "
were transferred to Belarus. Some of these civilian detainees were further transferred to the Russian 
"Federation. In five further cases, civilians were transferred from occupied territory to Government-"
controlled territory as a form of punitive “expulsion”.  
65. Persons transferred and their family members experienced human rights violations during or after 
"the transfers, including violations to the rights to respect of family life, to know the fate and "
"whereabouts of missing relatives, to liberty and security, and to be free from cruel, degrading and "
"inhumane treatment; the rights of children to preserve their identity, including nationality, name and "
"family relations, not to be separated from their parents against their will, and to family reunification; "
"the right of detained persons to have contact with the outside world, family visits and "
correspondence; and the right of detainees’ family members to be notified of the transfer and place 
of custody. 
"66. OHCHR documented that approximately 1,600 civilian prisoners who had been serving sentences "
in different penal colonies in the Kherson region before February 2022 were transferred to the 
"Russian Federation in early November and sent to penal colonies in Krasnodar, Rostov and "
Volgograd regions. OHCHR was able to establish the identity and general whereabouts of 75 of 
them. A family member of one such detainee told OHCHR that the man was first transferred from 
"where he was serving his sentence to the Northern Penal Colony No 90 in Kherson, where detainees "
"were forced to work repairing equipment for Russian military needs.30 In early November, he and "
other prisoners were deported to the Russian Federation. Families were not informed about the 
deportation of their loved ones. The authorities did not provide information about their fate and 
"whereabouts, which may also amount to enforced disappearance. Relatives were not able to send "
them letters or money directly. OHCHR has information about 27 transferred prisoners who were 
released upon the end of their sentence and immediately placed in detention centres for foreign 
"nationals, based on decisions of the Russian authorities ruling their stay in the Russian Federation "
undesirable and their deportation to Ukraine. 
67. OHCHR also documented cases where unaccompanied Ukrainian children were moved to the 
Russian Federation in possible violation of article 49 of Geneva Convention IV and article 78 of 
"Additional Protocol I. On 27 May 2022, a group of 31 children (16 boys and 15 girls) from Donetsk "
region were deported from the occupied city of Donetsk to the Russian Federation. The children were 
"in institutionalised care, lost or separated from their parents or guardians during the hostilities. Such "
"a girl, who had been undergoing medical treatment in Mariupol, was transferred to Donetsk with a "
"group of other children in March. From Donetsk, she was taken to a facility near Moscow, and by "
autumn she had been placed in foster care in the Moscow region. Her family in Government-
"controlled Ukraine did not know about her fate and whereabouts, and although they heard in the "
"media that she was in the Russian Federation, they did not have any contact with her as of 31 "
December 2022. Three children from the same group were taken to the Russian Federation after 
                                                
30 The man was able to call his relatives while he was still in Ukraine. 
 
"Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 1 August 2022 – 31 January 2023   |   19 their father failed to pass ‘filtration’ and was detained and subjected to enforced disappearance by "
Russian armed forces and affiliated groups.31 Four other children from this group were taken to the 
Russian Federation after their foster mother went missing during the hostilities in Mariupol. One boy 
"was transferred from the Mariupol area, where he lived with relatives, to Donetsk and then to the "
"Russian Federation, despite his family ties in Ukraine. He was placed in a foster family in the Moscow "
region and issued a Russian passport. The Russian Presidential Commissioner for the Rights of the 
"Child reported that she personally took into foster care one of the boys from the group, and that he "
"had received Russian citizenship in September.32 Pursuant to article 50 of Geneva Convention IV, "
the Russian Federation is prohibited from making changes to the personal status of displaced 
"children, including their nationality. "
"68. According to a statement from the Russian Federation Presidential Commissioner on Child Rights, "
"27 of these 31 children “voluntarily” remained in the Russian Federation, where two of them turned "
18. Three children were returned to their father33 and one child allegedly went back to live with 
neighbours in territory of Donetsk region occupied by the Russian Federation.34 According to the 
"Russian Federation Presidential Commissioner on Child Rights, as of 31 December 2022, 380 "
children from Donetsk and Luhansk regions were in foster families in the Russian Federation.35 In late 
"October 2022, the Russian authorities asserted that, after 24 February, up to 2,500 children from "
Ukraine were residing in temporary accommodation centres in the Russian Federation and that some 
"of them have remained there, while others were resettled to social institutions or placed in foster care "
with Russian families.36 
69. OHCHR has also documented that children from Russian-occupied parts of Kharkiv region were sent 
"to summer camps in the Russian Federation with the consent of their parents, but were not returned "
home at the end of the vacation period.37 The Russian authorities requested their parents to travel to 
"the Russian Federation in person to get their children back. In a summer camp in Krasnodarskyi Krai, "
"in the Russian Federation, about 200 children remained after the summer and were enrolled in a "
local school.38 OHCHR interviewed the mother of one child who faced financial and administrative 
hurdles associated with having to travel. She was able to get her child back three months later with

must take measures to avoid unnecessary separation of children from their families that is not in the 
best interest of the child.39 
70. It remains unclear how many unaccompanied children from Ukraine have been placed in summer 
"camps, temporary accommodation centres or institutionalised care in the Russian Federation, or how "
"many children were transferred there with their parents.40 Nevertheless, OHCHR has observed that "
there is no functioning mechanism for the reunification of children with their relatives in Ukraine. IHL 
"prohibits forced transfers of civilians within an occupied territory, and deportation outside such "
territory. It provides for a specific exception where an occupying power may undertake the 
temporary evacuation of the civilian population from a given area for the security of the population 
"or imperative military reasons, or specifically of children where there are compelling reasons of "
health or medical treatment. Whether such an exception is met needs to be determined in each 
particular case. 
Forced conscription  
"71. On 21 September 2022, the President of the Russian Federation ordered the start of a conscription "
campaign into the armed forces that also extended to men residing in Crimea. Although the exact 
"number of men from Crimea who were conscripted remains unclear, OHCHR noted numerous "
reports of Crimean residents being conscripted to participate in Russian military operations against 
"Ukraine. Under IHL, an occupying power may not compel protected persons to serve in its armed or "
auxiliary forces. No pressure or propaganda which aims at securing voluntary enlistment is 
"permitted.41 Furthermore, compelling a protected person to serve in the forces of a hostile power "
may amount to a war crime.42 
"72. In addition to conscription, the Russian Federation conducted two regular military drafts in 2022. "
"According to official announcements from the Russian occupation authorities in Crimea, 2,500 men "
from Crimea were conscripted in the autumn 2022 military draft to undergo compulsory military 
service. Criminal prosecution for draft evasion continued to be used to enforce conscription. Men 
were typically convicted for failing to appear at their local military draft commission upon receiving 
"an official summons. In one case, the central district court in Simferopol sentenced a second-year "
"university student with no source of income to pay a fine of 50,000 roubles. In another, the court "
"convicted and fined a university student 35,000 roubles. As of 31 December 2022, a total of 84 "
"men had been sanctioned for draft evasion during the occupation of Crimea. OHCHR notes that, "
                                                
"39 See United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, arts. 8-9. "
"40 In late October 2022, Russian authorities stated that after 24 February, during different time periods, between 1500 "
"and 2500 children from Ukraine were residing in temporary accommodation centres; some stayed there, while others "
"were resettled to social institutions or given to Russian foster families. According to the Ukrainian authorities, as of "
"mid-November 2022, 11,225 children were deported to the Russian Federation or forcibly transferred to Russian-"
"occupied territory of Ukraine. Of them, 7,644 were reported as transferred from Donetsk region, and 116 were "
orphaned or deprived of parental care.  No data is available regarding how many of them were unaccompanied.

"November 2022, and with National Information Bureau of Ukraine, 19 November 2022.) "
"41 Geneva Convention IV, art. 51. Legislative restrictions and penalties for media reporting and the expression of "
opinions (see section IV.D) mean that access to independent information about the armed attack against Ukraine 
"remains severely limited for any prospective service members. Furthermore, as noted in A/77/220, para. 44, State-"
controlled reporting and the introduction of special lessons in schools on the “operations” of the Russian military in 
Ukraine could be viewed as measures aimed at securing voluntary enlistment for engagement in hostilities against 
Ukraine.

"Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 1 August 2022 – 31 January 2023   |   21 under Russian domestic law, conviction for draft evasion does not absolve a person from the "
obligation to complete military service.  
C. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RIGHTS 
Right to social security and health 
73. The imposition by occupying authorities of various restrictions on the freedom of movement of 
residents of occupied territory has jeopardised their access to social security and health care and 
undermined their means of subsistence and to enjoy their right to life with dignity.43 OHCHR has 
"documented that residents of occupied territory of Kharkiv, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, with "
"scant access to their bank accounts and savings, were often left with little or no cash to provide for "
"their means of subsistence, as Ukrainian banks are not operational there. In Zalyzhnichne, Kharkiv "
"region, one man told OHCHR that his grandmother, who could not access her pension from January "
"until September when Ukraine regained control over the area, had no cash and survived only on "
the vegetables grown in her garden. 
"74. In areas of Kherson that were occupied by the Russian Federation until November, checkpoints "
established by Russian armed forces prevented people from leaving their villages from March until 
"the end of the occupation, which severely restricted access to medical assistance. OHCHR received "
several reports that older persons had died because they could not access essential medication. In 
"Balakliia, Kharkiv region, during the period of occupation, all checkpoints were closed and no "
"medical supplies could enter the city. Moreover, OHCHR documented that civilians receiving "
"medical treatment for cancer and other diseases in Kharkiv city were not allowed to leave Balakliia, "
"except on rare occasions. In one village in Kherson region, local residents, including older persons "
"with diabetes, were not allowed to travel to another settlement to obtain their medication. In Izium, "
"the central hospital was significantly damaged, partially occupied by Russian armed forces and "
turned into a military hospital. 
75. The ‘treaties’ of accession of occupied regions of Ukraine adopted by the Russian Federation in 
"September provided that, as a matter of Russian law, all Ukrainian citizens and stateless persons "
"permanently residing in these regions would be recognised as citizens of the Russian Federation, "
with the exception of those who failed to take an oath or formally rejected Russian citizenship within 
one month of the entry into force of the ‘treaties’.44 OHCHR notes with concern that residents of 
"occupied territory who wish to maintain their Ukrainian citizenship may be excluded from pension, "
social security and health insurance schemes administered by the Russian occupation authorities. 
  
                                                
"43 See Human Rights Committee, General Comment no. 36, para 26. "
"44 Article 5 of the “Treaties on the Accession of the Donetsk People’s Republic, the Lugansk People’s Republic, the "
Zaporozhye Region and the Kherson Region to the Russian Federation”. 
 
"Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 1 August 2022 – 31 January 2023   |   22 D. CIVIC SPACE AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS "
“We have enough material to arrest you any time 
again.”  
- An officer of a special police unit to a male Crimean Tatar 
human rights defender  
“Earlier we would say that Crimea is a grey zone. It 
has now gone totally black.” 
– A man human rights defender in Crimea  
"Freedoms of opinion, expression, assembly and association "
"76. During the reporting period, OHCHR documented 10 cases (7 men, 3 women) of enforced "
disappearances and arbitrary detentions of media workers and human rights defenders in territory 
"occupied by the Russian Federation. In the vast majority of these cases, the violations occurred before "
"the reporting period but were documented with a delay, either after the victims were released and "
"then moved to Government-controlled territory, or after the Government of Ukraine regained control "
over areas in Kherson and Kharkiv regions. OHCHR is concerned that shrinking civic space hinders 
individuals from freely reporting human rights violations or abuses that they may have experienced 
or witnessed. 
"77. Civilians who expressed pro-Ukrainian views and advocated in public spaces or via social media, "
"and civilians who were affiliated with Ukrainian political parties, were systematically threatened, "
"arbitrarily arrested and detained, tortured and ill-treated. Frequently, they were afterwards forcibly "
taken to humanitarian crossing points and ordered by Russian armed forces to go to territory under 
the control of the Government of Ukraine. 
"Freedoms of opinion, expression, assembly and association in Crimea "
"78. In Crimea, Russian authorities continued to prosecute individuals on the grounds of “public "
actions directed at discrediting” and “obstructing” the Russian armed forces. By 31 January 
"2023, OHCHR had documented 210 prosecutions (against 138 men and 72 women) since "
the introduction of these punishable offenses in 2022.45 No fewer than 206 prosecutions 
(against 137 men and 69 women) resulted in convictions. There was a progressive increase 
in the number of convictions throughout 2022. Convictions verified by OHCHR resulted in 
"fines ranging from 30,000 to 75,000 roubles and imprisonment from 5 to 15 days. Crimean "
"residents were convicted, inter alia , for various expressions made in private conversations "
"such as mentions of Russian “attack” or “aggression”, criticism of ‘Z’ and ‘V’ symbols used "
"by the Russian armed forces, and references to the occupation of Crimea. Public expressions "
"that became the basis for prosecution varied from social media posts, comments or “no war” "
"hashtags, to statements uttered in a public place involving calls for ending the war, criticism "
"of the Russian military or Russian President, or references to war crimes, occupation, suffering "
                                                
45 These acts are punishable under article 207.3 of the Russian Federation Criminal Code and the article 20.3.3 of 
"the Code of Administrative Offenses. These laws significantly restrict the right to freedom of expression, including the "
"freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds in accordance with ICCPR, art. 19(2). "
"Additionally, the application of such legislation in Crimea violates the Russian Federation’s obligation, as the "
"occupying Power, to respect the penal laws of the occupied territory according to Geneva Convention IV, art. 64. "
 
"Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 1 August 2022 – 31 January 2023   |   23 of civilians or “a terrorist state”. Some individuals were convicted for non -verbal expressions "
"such as watching video clips of “Bayraktar”46 on a personal mobile phone, wearing a blue "
"and yellow armband, displaying an anti-war tattoo and asking a disc jockey in a café to "
play a video clip depicting the Ukrainian army.  
"79. In one case, six individuals were charged with publicly displaying the symbol of an “extremist "
organization” and discrediting Russian armed forces two days after a disc jockey played a 
Ukrainian patriotic song during a wedding at a restaurant in Bakhchysarai on 10 September. 
"On 13 September, a local court in Bakhchysarai convicted the disc jockey, the mothers of "
"the bride and the groom, a guest, and the owner of the restaurant and his wife. Four of them "
"were sentenced to detention for periods ranging from 5 to 15 days, and the remaining two "
were ordered to pay administrative fines. The court considered an extract of the song calling 
"“to liberate brothers, Ukrainians from Moscow’s chains” to amount to “discrediting the "
Russian Federation Armed Forces”. 
80. Restrictions on the exercise of the right to freedom of expression particularly affected teachers 
"in Crimea. They were pressured to actively endorse the Russian armed attack on Ukraine, to "
cultivate a positive attitude among schoolchildren towards the military operations against 
"Ukraine, and to generally refrain from criticizing the Russian authorities. Teaching staff who "
"refused to follow these guidelines faced retaliation and sanctions. In one documented case, "
the school administration refused to prolong a contract with a female Crimean Tatar teacher 
following complaints by students’ parents. The teacher had discussed with her students alleged 
violations against civilians by the Russian armed forces in Ukraine. The teacher was also 
"convicted for “discrediting the Russian Federation Armed Forces”. On 10 August 2022, the "
Supreme Court of Crimea upheld the decision of a lower court confirming that she had 
expressed “personal opinion with the objective of forming the opinion of others”. She was 
"found guilty and fined 30,000 Russian roubles. The court made no reference to the victim’s "
right to freedom of expression or appropriate restriction of her rights on the basis of any 
legitimate public interest. The woman was forced to seek employment in a different region. 
 
"81. On 1 December, a law adopted by the Russian Federation came into force, which precludes ‘foreign "
"agents’ (i.e. those considered to be under the influence of foreign states, individuals or international "
organizations) from working in the public service or educational institutions and from organising 
public assemblies.47 The law purports to automatically apply in all territory that the Russian 
Federation occupies in Ukraine. OHCHR is concerned that the application of this new law by the 
"occupying power, in violation of its obligation to respect the laws of Ukraine in the administration "
"of occupied territory, could also seriously undermine freedoms of association and expression, the "
right to privacy and the right to participate in public affairs. 
Freedom of religion or belief  
"82. OHCHR documented three cases of enforced disappearance, arbitrary detention, torture or other ill-"
"treatment, and unlawful deportations perpetrated by Russian armed forces against clergy and "
"members of Ukrainian Greek Catholic and Christian Evangelical communities in Zaporizhzhia, "
                                                
46 Bayraktar is a Ukrainian patriotic propaganda song that became popular after its release on 1 March 2022. It refers 
to the Baykar Bayraktar TB2 combat drone and its deployment against Russian troops. 
"47 Law “On control of activities of individuals under foreign influence”, Federal Law No. 255-FZ. "
 
"Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 1 August 2022 – 31 January 2023   |   24 Kherson and Kharkiv regions. Moreover, the Russian occupation authorities raided, ransacked and "
"closed three places of worship belonging to the Baptist community in Melitopol, reportedly on the "
grounds of the community’s purported links with foreign intelligence services.48 The premises of the 
“Melitopol Christian Church” were further converted into a youth centre. 
83. OHCHR documented the case of a Baptist pastor from Kharkiv region who was abducted in May 
"by three masked men in uniforms of the Russian armed forces, then taken to a police station and "
"subjected to severe beatings. While being tortured, he was told that “there can be only the Russian "
Orthodox Church in the area” and that “there is no place for a Baptist church”. No information on 
"his fate and whereabouts was provided to his relatives, nor was his detention acknowledged by the "
occupation authorities before he was released without conditions.  
E. ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY 
“I went from being a witness to a suspect and then 
a defendant in a moment. At some point he [the 
investigator] asked me: ‘Who shot at civilian 
buildings in Mariupol?’ - I replied: ‘Russians did’. He 
"then said: ‘Oh, you are going in the wrong "
"direction’. Immediately after, two men in masks "
stormed into the room and dragged me to a toilet to 
beat me.”  
- A Ukrainian prisoner of war on his interrogation in Donetsk 
‘prosecutor's’ office 
 
"84. OHCHR interviewed 11 POWs (10 men and 1 woman) that have been indicted, tried or sentenced "
in Donetsk for mere participation in hostilities.49 OHCHR also documented torture and ill-treatment 
of POWs before or during their interrogations by so-called ‘prosecutors’ of Russian-affiliated armed 
"groups, either to compel them to confess, to testify against other individuals or to sign records of "
interrogations with statements that POWs had not provided. Five of POWs subjected to such 
interrogations told OHCHR they were not provided with legal counsel during the pre-trial 
investigation. 
85. Three POWs interviewed by OHCHR were tried in camera by a so-called ‘court’ lacking essential 
"guarantees of independence and impartiality. For instance, POWs tried in Donetsk complained that "
"the ‘judges’ were visibly biased against them, selecting only parts of their statements and testimony "
"that would support verdicts of guilt. Moreover, four POWs complained that their lawyers had not "
provided them with legal assistance and had only advised them to plead guilty. One POW 
sentenced to death penalty also reported that his supposedly free legal aid lawyer had contacted 
"his relatives and requested the equivalent of US$ 5,000 to file an appeal against the death sentence. "
                                                
"48 Those included “Novoe Pokolenie” (New Generation) or “Melitopol Christian Church”, “Slovo Zhyttia” (Word of "
Life) and “Blahodat” (Grace) temples. 
"49 Under customary IHL, individuals entitled to POW status have combatant immunity and cannot be prosecuted for "
"having participated in hostilities, or for lawful acts of war committed in the course of the international armed conflict, "
even if such acts would otherwise constitute an offence under domestic law. POWs charged with crimes or subject 
to disciplinary sanctions are entitled to due process and fair trial guarantees. No sentence or punishment may be 
"passed on them unless it is delivered by an impartial and regularly constituted court. See Geneva Convention IV, "
"arts. 99-108. See also ICCPR, art. 14; Geneva Convention III, arts. 102-108; Additional Protocol I, art. 75(4).  "

"the text of his indictment in Russian, although he had requested its translation into English.50 "
86. OHCHR notes that depriving a protected person of the rights to a fair trial is a grave breach of 
Geneva Convention III and Additional Protocol I.51 
"87. On 13 December 2022, the Parliament of the Russian Federation approved, in its first reading, a "
"draft federal law which, inter alia , provides for amnesties for the criminal offences committed in "
"territory of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions of Ukraine, where such offences "
were committed for the sake of “protecting the interests of the Russian Federation”.52 OHCHR is 
"concerned that, if adopted, this law could effectively grant amnesty for an overly broad range of "
"crimes, encompassing conduct constituting gross violations of IHRL or serious violations of IHL, as "
well as those amounting to international crimes. It may also impede the rights of victims to an effective 
"remedy, including reparation, and to know the truth about violations of IHRL and IHL. OHCHR recalls "
"that the Russian Federation has an obligation to investigate and prosecute war crimes, crimes against "
humanity and other gross human rights violations. 
  
                                                
50 Article 105 of Geneva Convention III provides that “documents which are generally communicated to the accused 
"by virtue of the laws in force in the armed forces of the Detaining Power, shall be communicated to the accused "
"prisoner of war in a language which he understands, and in good time before the opening of the trial”. "

"Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 1 August 2022 – 31 January 2023   |   26 V. HUMAN RIGHTS IN TERRITORY CONTROLLED "
BY THE GOVERNMENT OF UKRAINE  
A. RIGHT TO LIBERTY AND SECURITY OF PERSONS  
“People had their bones broken. This is what 
happens there”  
– A conflict-related man detainee on the treatment by the SBU 
in Odesa 
Conflict-related detentions  
"88. Since 24 February 2022, OHCHR has documented 91 cases of enforced disappearances53 and "
"arbitrary detentions54 (79 men, 12 women) committed by Ukrainian armed forces and law "
enforcement agencies in Government-controlled territory that occurred during and before the 
"reporting period (70 per cent in February-April, 22 per cent in May-July, 8 percent during the "
reporting period). Most detainees were arrested under suspicion of having collaborated with or 
aided Russian armed forces. Several others were apprehended under suspicion of having 
participated in armed groups in 2014-2015.  
"89. In some cases, the SBU apprehended victims in their homes or on the street and held them in police "
"departments, SBU buildings or makeshift places of detention (such as private houses or basements) "
"for up to three days without access to a lawyer. In some cases, they did not register the arrest. "
"OHCHR notes that, under Ukrainian law, law enforcement officers can legally arrest and detain "
"persons without judicial review for up to three days,55 but these persons are entitled to a lawyer from "
"the moment of their apprehension. Moreover, while authorities must allow arrested or detained "
"persons to inform a family member of the fact and place of detention, this is rarely respected in "
practice. The use of incommunicado detention deprives individuals of due process guarantees they 
"are entitled to, and exposes them to greater risks of being tortured or ill-treated. In this regard, "
OHCHR notes that in 43 per cent of documented cases of enforced disappearances and arbitrary 
"detentions, members of Ukrainian armed forces and law enforcement agencies tortured or ill-treated "
"the detainees by punching them, beating them with batons, electrocuting them or threatening to "
"maim or execute them, or to beat their loved ones or subject them to sexual violence. The torture or "
ill-treatment was carried out in order to extract information or compel detainees to confess or 
"incriminate themselves, often on camera.  "
"90. In one case, the police apprehended a woman in Donetsk region and handed her over to the SBU "
"in early March for allegedly passing information to Russian armed forces, which she denied. She "
                                                
"53 Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, arts. 1-2. Ukraine ratified the Convention "
in 2015. 
"54 In March 2022, Ukraine notified the United Nations Secretary-General of its derogation from certain human rights "
"obligations for the duration of the martial law, including article 9 of the ICCPR, which prohibits the arbitrary or "
unlawful deprivation of liberty. The Human Rights Committee has maintained that the fundamental guarantee against 
"arbitrary detention is non-derogable, including the protection against deprivation of liberty that is unreasonable or "
"unnecessary under the circumstances. Moreover, the lawfulness of the derogation must be assessed in each particular "
"case on the basis of whether “strictly required by the exigencies of the situation”. ICCPR, art. 4(1); General Comment "
"no. 35, paras. 4, 65-66. "
55 Articles 211 and amendments to article 615 of the Criminal Procedure Code made on 27 July 2022.   
 
"Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 1 August 2022 – 31 January 2023   |   27 was held at a police station for two days without access to the outside world. During interrogations, "
"SBU officers hit her in her ribs, placed a bag over her head and electrocuted her several times, "
"requesting her to confess in writing. She eventually confessed responsibility under duress, after the "
SBU officers brought her friend to a room and tortured him with electricity in front of her. 
91. OHCHR is particularly concerned about the ill-treatment of a 17-year-old boy who was detained by 
members of territorial defence forces and handed over to the SBU in Donetsk region in April. Under 
"threat of death and violence to his family, the boy was forced to confess on video-camera that he "
had transmitted the positions of Ukrainian armed forces to Russian intelligence. The boy was not 
informed about his right to legal aid or offered a lawyer. He was held in solitary confinement at a 
"temporary detention facility for three days, during which he was fed only once, had no access to "
"potable water and slept on a bare plank bed. After his transfer to a pre-trial detention facility, two "
guards threatened to beat him up for allegedly being a ‘separatist’. He was accused of state treason 
"punishable by 15 years or life imprisonment, and the proceedings in his case have been held in "
camera. 
92. The arbitrary deprivation of liberty of 88 civilian Russian sailors for approximately eight months 
resulted in the death of one of them. They had legally entered Ukraine before 24 February 2022 
"but were not allowed to disembark from their vessels in Izmail, Odesa region, after the beginning "
"of the armed attack.56 On 23 August, one male sailor died because he did not receive sufficient "
"medical care for a chronic condition. On 7 and 8 September, OHCHR attempted to visit the sailors "
"but was denied access by the Ukrainian authorities. On 17 October, the sailors were released "
during a prisoner exchange between Ukraine and the Russian Federation. 
Amendments to the legal framework on the prevention of torture 
"93. In a welcome development, on 1 December, the Parliament adopted a law amending the "
Criminal Code and in order to align national legislation with the Convention against Torture 
"and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (draft law no. 5336). The "
law notably brings the domestic definition of “torture” in line with the Convention by 
"including acts committed at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of, a "
public official or other person acting in an official capacity. The prison term for torture 
"committed by a State agent ranges between 7 and 12 years, whereas the maximum "
"duration was previously set at only five years. In addition, the law establishes that no statute "
of limitation applies to the crime of torture committed by a State agent. 
 
"Gender-based violence, including sexual violence "
"94. From 24 February 2022 to 31 January 2023, OHCHR documented 24 cases of CRSV (18 men and "
6 women) in Government-controlled territory of Ukraine.57 All cases occurred from March to July 
2022. They mostly affected men and consisted predominantly of threats of sexual violence by 
Ukrainian law enforcement agencies during the initial stages of detention. Many cases also consisted 
                                                
"56 Ukraine did not justify why it was in the national interest to prohibit the sailors from leaving the territory of Ukraine, "
"and did not follow the appropriate procedures for such a prohibition: see Geneva Convention IV, art. 35. Ukraine "
did not intern the sailors in line with requirements of articles 41-43 of the Convention or detain them in a manner 
otherwise reasonable or necessary in accordance with IHRL. 
"57 As noted above in section IV.B, OHCHR documented 13 cases of CRSV in total throughout this period. "
 
"Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 1 August 2022 – 31 January 2023   |   28 of forced public stripping of alleged lawbreakers, perpetrated mostly by civilians or members of "
territorial defence forces.  
"95. In 13 cases, Ukrainian law enforcement officials beat the genitals of detainees, threatened them with "
"sexual violence and forced them to strip.58 In one case, SBU officers beat, stripped and threatened "
to rape and cut the genitals of a man to force him to confess to cooperation with the FSB. He was 
told that the rape would be recorded and the video sent to his children. 
96. OHCHR acknowledges the efforts of the Government of Ukraine to integrate a victim-centred 
approach into CRSV investigations59 and to provide assistance to survivors.60 On 16 December 
"2022, the Government updated a National Action Plan for the implementation of United Nations "
"Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security which will cover the period up to "
2025. It aims to ensure the provision of effective and timely assistance to victims of gender-based 
"violence, CRSV and human trafficking.61  "
"97. By the end of January 2023, the Office of the Prosecutor General reported that it had initiated "
investigations into 155 cases of CRSV committed by Russian armed forces (65 cases in Kherson 
"region, 52 cases in Kyiv region, 17 cases in Donetsk region, 9 cases in Kharkiv region, 6 cases in "
"Zaporizhzhia region, 4 cases in Chernihiv region, 1 case in Mykolaiv region, 1 case in Luhansk "
"region) against 106 women, 38 men and 11 girls since February 2022.  "
"98. OHCHR welcomes the ratification of the Istanbul Convention by Ukraine, which entered into force "
"on 1 November, and aims to protect, prevent, and combat violence against women and domestic "
violence.  
"99. Due in particular to active hostilities, displacement, and occupation of parts of the Ukrainian territory, "
the number of complaints for domestic violence to the police decreased in 2022 in comparison with 
"2021.62 This decrease, combined with the lack of specialists, prompted the Government of Ukraine, "
"with the support of international partners, to take measures to improve the availability of support "
"services for victims and survivors of gender-based violence. For instance, in August, a mobile "
application for women victims of gender-based violence was launched. The panic button sends an 
automatic call for help to the police without the victim having to call them.63

"Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 1 August 2022 – 31 January 2023   |   29 Treatment of prisoners of war  "
" ""They [soldiers from Ukrainian armed forces] "
"didn't let me sleep, tied me to something, kicked "
"me the whole night, beat my head with some hard "
"object, and said: “You take up arms again, we "
will kill your family.”  
– A Russian prisoner of war who was tortured during the first 
night of his captivity  
 
 
"100. During the reporting period, the Ukrainian Government continued to grant OHCHR full and "
unimpeded access to the official places of internment of POWs. OHCHR interviewed 88 Russian 
"POWs (87 men, 1 woman) in eight places of internment64 and after their release. In 46 per cent of "
"documented cases, OHCHR documented patterns of torture or other ill-treatment perpetrated by "
"Ukrainian armed forces, military police or the SBU, usually at the beginning of captivity or during "
initial interrogations or evacuations. Detailed information on the treatment of POWs in the hands of 
Ukraine is reflected in a separate report published in March 2023.65 
Killings of Civilians 
101. OHCHR continued to corroborate reports of dozens of killings of civilians perceived as so-called 
‘traitors’ against Ukraine for their alleged collaboration with the Russian Federation in territory 
occupied by it or controlled by Russian armed forces since 24 February 2022. While the 
"perpetrators remain unknown, OHCHR has concerns that some of these killings may have been "
committed by agents of the Government of Ukraine or with its acquiescence. Given that in most of 
"the reported cases the victims do not appear to have been legitimate military targets, there is need "
for thorough and impartial investigations into such cases.  
B. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RIGHTS 
Right to social security and health 
"102. In 2017, the Government of Ukraine adopted the “Affordable Medicines Programme”, an outpatient "
"reimbursement scheme to improve access to prescription medicines. During the reporting period, "
access to this programme in conflict-affected areas became limited by unreliable mobile and internet 
network connections and frequent power cuts caused by Russian strikes on energy infrastructure. 
"Without functioning communication networks, primary healthcare service providers cannot transmit "
digital prescriptions to patients and pharmacies cannot verify the patients’ eligibility. 
                                                
"64 SIZOs in Dnipro, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Poltava, Zaporizhzhia, Odesa, Kryvyi Rih and the POW camp in Lviv region. "

"Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 1 August 2022 – 31 January 2023   |   30 103. OHCHR welcomes the Government’s decision to maintain and continue to pay pensions in all areas "
"of Ukraine, including to those who were registered as IDPs before 24 February 2022.66 However, "
OHCHR notes that social assistance for those in need remains frequently inadequate.67 Social 
"assistance is based on a statutory minimum assistance level set down in the State Budget Law, which "
covered only half of the real costs of living as estimated by the Ministry of Social Policy in January 
"2022.68 Despite an inflation rate of over 25 per cent, social assistance levels will remain the same "
"for 2023, as the Budget Law adopted on 3 November did not increase the statutory minimum. "
"Moreover, social assistance provided to persons with disabilities is based on the statutory subsistence "
level for people who have lost their ability to work and are thus eligible for financial compensation 
"by the State. However, the amount of social assistance set for this category of beneficiaries is lower "
"than other categories, even if persons with disabilities often face greater living costs, notably in "
securing suitable transportation and accessible housing. 
104. OHCHR is concerned that conditions attached to loans from international donors may further restrict 
"Ukraine’s ability to ensure the right to social security. On 21 December, the Ukrainian Government "
agreed with the International Monetary Fund to cap social payments as a condition for receiving 
"increased funding. Although no details are available about what this will mean in practice,69 "
OHCHR is concerned that such a condition may make the lives of those in a vulnerable situation 
even more precarious. OHCHR notes that the World Bank has warned of a significant rise in poverty 
levels in Ukraine.70 
Right to an adequate standard of living including housing 
105. OHCHR continues to document inadequate housing in conflict-affected areas where many people’s 
homes have been damaged or destroyed. The Government passed a resolution outlining the 
procedures for undertaking urgent repair work to homes in areas where there are no more 
"hostilities.71 OHCHR notes, however, the absence of any provisions prioritising people in vulnerable "
"situations such as older persons, who constitute the majority of civilians remaining in these areas.  "
"106. In areas of central and western Ukraine perceived as being relatively safe, rents have substantially "
"increased with the influx of IDPs.72 The increase has forced many IDPs, including some who receive "
"housing assistance from the Government, to remain for long periods of time in ill-equipped collective "
"centres. For example, in January 2023, OHCHR interviewed a woman with a disability who had "
"been staying in a collective centre since April 2022, as she could not afford to rent private "
"accommodation. In some cases, IDPs have decided to return home in areas affected by hostilities. "
"For instance, in October and November 2022, three women and one man from Izium, Kramatorsk "

"107. Although the Government has adopted affordable mortgage programmes, OHCHR notes that these "
programmes are unlikely to support the most vulnerable and those dependent on social assistance 
due to interest rates of seven per cent for IDPs and deposit requirements.73 The Government has not 
yet adopted measures to ensure access to affordable housing for the most vulnerable.74  
"108. Moreover, the series of Russian missile strikes targeting critical energy infrastructure since October "
"have severely impacted those with mobility problems, including older persons and persons with "
"disabilities, who fear using elevators in case of a power cut. They are less able to leave their "
"apartments, and therefore prevented from accessing medication, food and the heating points set up "
"by the Government to provide heating, electricity and water to those without power.75 "
C. CIVIC SPACE AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS  
"Freedoms of opinion, expression, assembly  "
"109. On 13 December, the Parliament of Ukraine adopted the Law “On Media”, which aims to update "
the legal framework governing media and ensure its compliance with international standards.76 
OHCHR is concerned that the law disproportionally restricts the use of minority languages in media 
by increasing the State language quota requirements for broadcasters. The new law requires 
licensed television broadcasters to increase the proportion of broadcasting in Ukrainian from 75 to 
"90 per cent at national and regional levels, and from 60 to 80 per cent at local level. The law "
provides for the preferential treatment of official languages of the European Union as compared to 
"other minority languages, without stated justification. It contains several provisions restricting "
"freedom of expression, including a ban on the publication of material that promotes the actions of "
"the “aggressor-state”, and the prohibition for “citizens and entities of the aggressor-state” to "
"broadcast in Ukraine.77 In OHCHR’s view, these provisions do not meet the standards for permissible "
restrictions on freedom of expression under IHRL.78 
Freedom of religion or belief  
"110. During the reporting period, three draft laws in these areas were registered in Parliament. Draft law "
"no. 8221 bans the Russian Orthodox Church, as well as the operations of religious organizations "
"that are organizationally or canonically linked to it, and prohibits them from renting state or private "
                                                
73 Decree №  56 
74 The Draft law registered on 30 March 2022 allowing for the establishment of marginal rental prices has not yet 
been adopted. 
"75 Cabinet of Ministers Resolution No. 1401, “ Issues of organization and functioning of points of invincibility”, 17 "
December 2022.  Available at: https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/1401-2022-%D0%BF#Text .  
76 The law will enter into force on 31 March 2023 with the exception of certain provisions which will enter into force 
on other dates as prescribed by the Law. 
77 An exception is prescribed for “citizens of the aggressor state” who have residence permits in Ukraine. 
78  Restrictions on freedom of expression imposed by the law are so overly broad that they fail to meet the tests of 
"necessity and proportionality for such restrictions, as established by article 19 (3) of the ICCPR and interpreted by "
the Human Rights Committee. The categories outlined in the law relating to the publication of material that promotes 
"the actions of aggressor or occupying State, and of material featuring persons included in the list of persons who are "
"posing a threat to the national media space, exceed in their scope specific threats to national security. In addition, "
"the law forbids individuals or entities from broadcasting in Ukraine simply because they are citizens, residents, or "
"are linked to an aggressor or occupying State, which appears discriminatory in nature and likewise fails to meet the "
standards for permissible restrictions under article 19 (3).  
 
"Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 1 August 2022 – 31 January 2023   |   32 property in Ukraine. The draft law also foresees banning the use of the term “Orthodox” in names "
of religious organizations not related to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine. OHCHR notes that due to 
"vague legal terminology and the absence of sufficient justification, the limitations of the freedom to "
manifest one’s religion contained in the draft law cannot be regarded as “prescribed by law” and 
“necessary” within the meaning of article 18(3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights (ICCPR).79 
111. Draft law no. 8262 simplifies the procedure for the transition of religious communities from one 
religious organization to another by lifting certain formal requirements.80 It also includes provisions 
prohibiting religious organizations affiliated with decision-making centres in the Russian Federation 
from renting state and municipal property. 
112. Draft law no. 8371 establishes a procedure for the dissolution of religious organizations with links 
"to the Russian Federation. It refers to them as “religious organizations affiliated with influence centres, "
the management of which is located outside Ukraine in the country which carries out armed 
aggression against Ukraine”. 
113. The SBU conducted searches (some of which it referred to as “security measures”)81  in several 
"monasteries, offices, education facilities and other property of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church "
"(UOC)82 in Kyiv, Rivne, Zhytomyr, Ivano-Frankivsk, Chernivtsi, Dnipropetrovsk, Khmelnytskyi, "
"Cherkasy, Volyn, Kherson, Ternopil, Poltava and Zakarpattia regions.83 In some cases, SBU officers "
questioned several clergymen with the use of a polygraph. The SBU confirmed that at least three 
notices of suspicion were issued to UOC clergy – two under article 161 of the Criminal Code 
"(violating the equality of citizens based on race, nationality, religious belief, disability or other "
grounds) and one with multiple charges including trespass against the territorial integrity and 
"inviolability of Ukraine, and denial of the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against "
Ukraine. At least two suspects are under round-the-clock house arrest. OHCHR is concerned that the 
State’s activities targeting the UOC could be discriminatory. OHCHR also recalls the need to ensure 
that all those facing criminal charges enjoy the full spectrum of applicable fair trial rights.  
Law on Minorities 
114. OHCHR notes the adoption of the Law “On National Minorities (Communities) of Ukraine” on 13 
"December. While welcoming the additional guarantees provided to national minorities,84 OHCHR "
is concerned that the law does not eliminate various provisions of Ukrainian legislation that provide 
"for differential treatment between European Union languages, languages of indigenous peoples and "
                                                
"79 On 1 March 2022, Ukraine notified the United Nations Secretary-General of the derogation from certain of its "
"human rights obligations, in accordance with article 4 of the ICCPR. Ukraine notified the United Nations Secretary "
"General of its waiver of obligations under arts. 3, 8(3), 9, 12, 13, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26 and 27 of the "
"ICCPR. Article 4(2) of the ICCPR specifically provides that no derogation may be made from article 18, which contains "
inter alia provisions on freedom of religion.  
"80 For instance, by allowing a transition by vote of the majority present instead of the majority of the community.  "
"81 The SBU stated that warrants were issued authorizing searches in Dnipro, Rivne, Ternopil and some facilities in Kyiv. "
"82 The Ukrainian Orthodox Church, often informally referred to as “Moscow Patriarchate”, is one of largest Orthodox "
"Christian religious organizations currently active in Ukraine. In February 2022, leaders of the UOC criticized the "
actions of Russian Federation and declared the cutting of organizational ties with the Russian Orthodox Church. 
These decisions of the UOC were later formalized through changing its charter. 
83 Procedural requirements for investigative activities (including searches) are reflected in the Ukrainian Criminal 
"Procedure Code. While the activities of the SBU were similar to searches, these actions were officially referred to as "
‘security measures’. The SBU did not specify why it did not apply the regular search procedure. 
"84 For instance, article 10(2) of the Law allows individuals belonging to national minorities to hold public events "
"(meetings, conferences, rallies, exhibitions, training courses, seminars, training sessions, discussions, fora and others) "
in the languages of these national minorities. 
 
"Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 1 August 2022 – 31 January 2023   |   33 other minority languages in several fields, including secondary level education, advertising, print "
"media, film distribution and screening, television and radio broadcasting, book publishing and "
"distribution, scientific publications, and computer software.85 Moreover, in those areas where "
"persons belonging to minorities reside in substantial numbers, the law does not explicitly provide for "
"the use of minority languages in communications with public authorities, or for geographical names "
or toponyms in those languages.86 OHCHR is also concerned by the provision restricting certain 
rights of national minorities87 “belonging to the aggressor state” for the duration of the martial law 
"and for six months after its revocation, which may constitute violations of several rights of the ICCPR.  "
D. ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY 
"115. OHCHR continues to monitor the prosecution of war crimes in Ukraine. During the reporting period, "
Ukrainian courts found 20 members of the Russian armed forces guilty of violating the rules and 
"customs of war, specifically for torturing civilians, indiscriminate shelling of civilian objects and "
pillage of civilian property. OHCHR welcomes the efforts of the Government of Ukraine to prosecute 
"war crimes and uphold the rights of victims to truth and effective remedies, but has concerns about "
"the overall fairness of certain proceedings. In particular, 12 perpetrators were sentenced in absentia , "
"which in some circumstances may violate the right to be present during one’s trial. In these cases, "
the courts and prosecutors summoned the defendants by merely publishing a notice in Ukrainian 
media or on the court websites. Such measures may constitute insufficient proof that the defendants 
were notified of trial dates and waived their right to be present.88 
                                                
85 Such differential treatment is provided by the Law “On ensuring the functioning of the Ukrainian language as the 
state language” and the Law “On general secondary education”. 
86 This may contravene Article 11.3 of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and Article 
10.2 of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. 
"87 These include the right to freedom of peaceful assembly, the right to receive state funding for events associated with "
"the implementation of the rights and freedoms of national minorities, the right of representatives of national minority "
"NGOs to participate in advisory bodies of state administrations and local councils, and other rights mentioned in "
paragraph 3 of the “Transitional Provisions” of the law. 
88 The United Nations Human Rights Committee in Maleki v. Italy concluded that a State bore a burden of proof to 
demonstrate that the accused had been “summoned in a timely manner” and “informed of the proceedings against 
him”. The Committee reasoned that it is the obligation of a domestic court to verify that the accused had actual 
knowledge about a case before commencing a trial in absentia . Merely taking steps to inform an accused and 
"assuming, in light of those steps, that the accused has acquired actual knowledge of the proceedings against him is "
insufficient.

"116. During the reporting period, Ukrainian courts delivered guilty verdicts against 69 men from Russian-"
"affiliated armed groups, captured as POWs after 24 February 2022. They were charged with inter "
"alia trespass against territorial integrity, state treason, membership in a terrorist organization, "
membership in unlawful armed formation and unlawful possession of firearms. Prison sentences 
"ranged from 11 and 15 years. In interviews with OHCHR, ten POWs reported that courts had not "
examined the criminal charges against them and stated that they only pleaded guilty in order to be 
sentenced promptly and be included in an exchange of POWs. OHCHR recalls that sentencing 
members of Russian-affiliated armed groups for conduct constituting mere participation in the 
"hostilities violates their combatant privilege. Moreover, OHCHR notes with concern that in cases for "
"state treason,89 where intent is a mandatory element of the crime, Ukrainian courts did not consider "
the impact of forced recruitment of numerous members of Russian-affiliated armed groups.90 
117. OHCHR also continued to follow criminal proceedings against civilians prosecuted for conflict-
"related crimes.91 During the reporting period, Ukrainian courts rendered 271 verdicts in such cases "
against 273 persons (179 men and 94 women). OHCHR remains concerned that defendants are 
"often denied the possibility of release on bail, which may put them under undue duress, as previously "
"reported.92 Of concern, on 26 August 2022, an investigative judge of the Krasnohvardiiskyi district "
"court in Dnipro did not allow OHCHR to observe a bail hearing in a conflict-related criminal case, "
                                                
"89 While IHL does not explicitly prohibit the prosecution for state treason of combatants who defected, OHCHR is "
concerned that the prosecution for state treason of persons serving in Russian-affiliated armed groups is inconsistent 
with the principle of combatant immunity 
"90 See article 370 of the Criminal Procedure Code of Ukraine, No.4651-VI of 12 April 2012.  "
"91 Crimes against national security (articles 109 - 114-2, chapter I of the Special Part of the Criminal Code), certain "
"crimes against public security (articles 258 - 258-5, 260 chapter IX of the Special Part of the Criminal Code), crimes "
"against peace, security of humanity and international order (articles 436 – 438, chapter XX of the Criminal Code).  "

"Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 1 August 2022 – 31 January 2023   |   35 referring to the protection of the parties’ health during the COVID-19 quarantine.93 Based on an "
"analysis of 909 court judgments in conflict-related criminal cases, OHCHR found that courts "
"remanded defendants in custody pending criminal proceedings in all but 30 cases. In this regard, "
OHCHR notes with concern that the Head of the SBU stated in a media interview that its agency 
"had met with chairpersons of the Supreme Court and appeal courts, with the aim of ensuring that "
conflict-related detainees are not released from pre-trial detention pending the finalisation of 
proceedings.94 
118. OHCHR welcomes the stated commitment of the General Prosecutor’s Office of Ukraine to investigate 
"all allegations of mistreatment of POWs, but regrets the lack of significant developments in these "
"investigations and that no cases have yet been brought before courts. Of concern, since 24 February "
"2022, OHCHR has recorded from interviews and open sources seven incidents involving the "
"summary executions of around 25 POWs and persons hors de combat , allegedly perpetrated by "
"Ukrainian armed forces. In relation to five of these incidents involving 22 victims, Ukraine has "
initiated pre-trial investigations. OHCHR notes that these investigations have not yet resulted in 
charges being brought against any of the alleged perpetrators.  
Law on collaboration activities 
"119. According to the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, as of 31 January 2023, 4,291 "
criminal proceedings had been launched under article 111-1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine for 
collaborating with the Russian Federation.95 OHCHR is concerned that the law on collaboration 
"activities does not comply with IHRL and IHL. In particular, the law encompasses individuals who "
"carry out uncoerced work for the occupying authorities, which may include educational and medical "
"workers, among others providing key services. This provision is not in line with the principles "
"underlying the law of occupation under IHL,96 compliance with which presumes a certain level of "
"cooperation between the occupation and local authorities. In addition, articles 50 and 56 of Geneva "
Convention IV explicitly require the cooperation of national and local authorities with the occupying 
power to ensure the functioning of medical establishments and educational and care facilities for 
children.  
"120. Moreover, the use of vague and subjective terminology in article 111-1 does not sufficiently comply "
"with international human rights standards on restrictions of the rights to liberty, security of persons "
                                                
93 OHCHR notes that neither the judge nor the parties wore any protective gear like masks at the beginning of the 
"hearing, before OHCHR was ordered to leave the courtroom. On 13 September, OHCHR wrote to the court "
"requesting that the judge share the records (including video and audio records) of the hearings, but has not received "
any reply.

"95 This article, which establishes criminal liability for collaborating with an “aggressor State”, was introduced by law "
"no. 2108-IX, which was adopted by the Parliament of Ukraine on 3 March 2022. The law punishes a wide range of "
"conducts, including denying the existence of an aggression against Ukraine, working for and transferring property "
"to occupying authorities, holding positions in courts or law enforcement authorities of the occupying power. The "
"penalties include banning offenders from specific activities or posts, confiscation of private property, and up to life "
in prison. 
"96 In accordance with these principles, the occupying power does not acquire sovereignty over the occupied territory "
and is required to maintain a life in the occupied territory as normal as possible.  
 
"Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 1 August 2022 – 31 January 2023   |   36 and freedom of expression,97 or with the principle of legality.98 OHCHR is also concerned at the "
apparent lack of proportionality between offences and applicable penalty.  
"121. In addition, the broad language of the law,99 which de facto criminalises all employment and "
"business activities in the occupied territory, may impact the enjoyment of the rights to work and to "
an adequate standard of living100 for residents in Russian-occupied territory.101 OHCHR is concerned 
that the law may have a far-reaching impact not only on the rights of individuals living in occupied 
"territory, but also on social cohesion and, ultimately, on future reintegration efforts.102 "
Civilians prosecuted for the alleged crime of collaboration activity 
"122. During the reporting period, OHCHR interviewed eight individuals (three men and five "
"women) prosecuted for the alleged crime of collaboration activity, including five persons "
who were charged with collaboration activity for continuing to work in a local public 
administration or under the occupation authorities while their villages and towns were 
"occupied.103 In one case, an elderly woman who volunteered, without affiliation, to distribute "
"food, was charged with collaboration activity and now faces 15 years in prison. Moreover, "
several individuals suspected of collaborating with the Russian Federation complained of 
"arbitrary arrests, incommunicado detention in unofficial places, torture or ill-treatment during "
"interrogations to extract confessions, denial of access to legal aid or other violations of the "
right to a fair trial. 
 
  
                                                
"97 According to IHRL, these rights can be restricted only subject to strict conditions (see articles 9(1) and 19(3) of the "
ICCPR and article 1 of Protocol to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms). 
"One of these conditions is that such restrictions must be provided by law, which must be formulated with sufficient "
"precision to enable an individual to regulate his or her conduct accordingly (See Human Rights Committee, General "
"Comment No. 35, para. 22; Human Rights Committee, General Comment No. 34, para. 25; European Court of "
"Human Rights, Beyeler v. Italy [Grand Chamber], para. 109). "
98 Article 15 of the ICCPR requires that “all elements of crime are in explicit and precise terms encapsulated in the legal 
"definitions of the crimes” (A/HRC/10/3/Add.2, para. 53).  "
99 The law criminalizes “commercial activities in co-operation with the aggressor state or the occupation authorities”. 
The scope of such “co-operation” is not defined.   
"100 Enshrined in articles 6 and 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  "
"101 Indeed, such individuals knowing that they may receive harsh punishments for collaboration activities, may, de "
"facto, be forced to stop working in occupied territory. This, in turn, may result in the loss of their income and, thus, "
"limit their and their families’ access to adequate food, clothing, housing, heating and other living conditions.   "
"102 OHCHR notes that, following the enactment of the law, a number of draft laws containing amendments to it were "
"registered in parliament. However, these draft laws also raise concerns about their compliance with international "
standards. 
103 OHCHR was informed that to determine individuals who collaborated with the Russian Federation in the areas 
"recently retaken by Ukraine, SBU officers often interrogated individuals who remained in their villages during the "
Russian occupation. Such measures were carried out in the course of the so-called ‘filtration’ procedures.  
 
"Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 1 August 2022 – 31 January 2023   |   37 VI. TECHNICAL COOPERATION AND CAPACITY "
BUILDING 
   
"123. During the reporting period, OHCHR published its 34th periodic report on the human rights situation "
"in Ukraine; a thematic report on Killings of civilians in Kyiv, Chernihiv, and Sumy regions; and a "
three-month update on the human rights situation in Ukraine. OHCHR also released weekly updates 
on civilian casualties in Ukraine. OHCHR public reports are an important tool for advocacy by 
"diverse actors with the Government to better respect, protect and fulfill human rights, on the basis of "
reliable and verified information about human rights and humanitarian law violations committed in 
"Ukraine, enabling action to be taken for the protection of victims and for the accountability of "
perpetrators. 
124. OHCHR engaged in sustained advocacy efforts with the Ukrainian Government on the protection of 
"POWs. In November, it issued two statements presenting HRMMU’s findings on the treatment of "
POWs. OHCHR also undertook advocacy efforts with and provided technical advice to the 
"Ukrainian Parliament, recommending amendments to several laws to bring them in line with "
international standards and best practices.  OHCHR shared with the Prosecutor General’s Office 
"data on civilian casualties among children from 2014 to 2021, to support the improvement of "
national capacity to record civilian casualties. 
"125. During his country visit to Ukraine in December 2022, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, "
"Volker Türk, met with Government officials and called for strict compliance with international human "
"rights and humanitarian law, encouraged accountability for all victims of the conflict, and advocated "
"for strengthening the rule of law, civic space and democratic society in Ukraine. He also met with "
civil society organizations and families of victims and POWs. 
"126. OHCHR supported the United Nations Country Team in Ukraine (UNCT), including through "
developing joint UNCT submissions to the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
and to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. OHCHR also 
"coordinated joint comments, with UNDP and UNHCR, to Ukraine’s amended national human rights "
"strategy. In addition, OHCHR prepared regular updates on the six grave violations against children "
"in times of war, and coordinated the UNCT contribution to the Secretary-General on conflict-related "
sexual violence. 
"127. HRMMU issued 3 statements and 43 social media posts, and appeared in over 665 media articles "
during the reporting period. 
  
 
"Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 1 August 2022 – 31 January 2023   |   38 VII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS "
"128. A year after the Russian Federation launched a full-scale armed attack against Ukraine, the hostilities "
"continue to exert a severe toll on children, women and men across the country. OHCHR reiterates "
"all calls upon the Russian Federation to immediately cease its armed attack, and for all parties to the "
conflict to fully respect their obligations under IHRL and IHL and to actively pursue a just and durable 
"peace, in line with the UN Charter and international law, through intensified diplomacy and "
dialogue. It also calls on all Member States to support such a resolution of the international armed 
conflict.  
"129. While OHCHR has not been able to assess compliance with IHL for each individual incident, the "
"patterns, frequency, scale and severity of civilian casualties and of destruction of and damage to "
civilian objects – including hospitals and schools – strongly indicate that recurring violations of IHL 
have taken place. 
"130. OHCHR is gravely concerned, in particular, by cases of killings, enforced disappearances, conflict-"
"related sexual violence, forced transfers and deportation, forced conscription, torture and other ill-"
"treatment of POWs, as well as significant restrictions to civil and political rights, and the broad "
"impact of the armed conflict on the enjoyment of economic, social, and cultural rights across society. "
OHCHR reminds all parties to the conflict that the information in its reports aims to enable duty-
"bearers to take actions for the protection of victims, hold perpetrators to account, provide remedies "
"and prevent further violations. OHCHR recalls that accountability should be pursued at all levels, "
with prioritisation of a victim-centered approach and support for survivors. National programmes of 
"reparation and assistance to victims should also be considered, without awaiting the formal "
outcomes of legal proceedings. 
"131. OHCHR urges the implementation of the following recommendations, many of which have already "
been raised in previous reports: 
132. To all parties to the conflict: 
"a) Respect and ensure respect for international human rights law and IHL, "
at all times and in all circumstances;

reparations;

1SUMMARY
This update focuses on key human rights developments 
"in Ukraine, including in territory occupied by the Russian "
Federation. It covers the period from 1 February to 
"30 April 2023. OHCHR’s regular biannual report, "
"covering the period from 1 February to 3 1 July 2023, "
will be published in September 2023. 
Although civilian casualties have decreased 
"compared with the previous three months, intense "
"fighting along the frontline, as well as the high "
concentration of explosive remnants of war in areas 
over which the Government of Ukraine regained 
"control in the autumn of 2023, continued to inflict a "
heavy toll on the civilian population. 
"On 27 April 2023, the President of the Russian "
Federation signed a decree purporting to provide 
that people residing in the occupied areas of 
"Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Donetsk and Luhansk regions "
would retroactively be considered “foreigners” as 
"of 30 September 2022, unless they had obtained "
Russian citizenship. While the decree does not impose 
"Russian citizenship, it obliges Ukrainian citizens who "
reside in occupied territory to comply with a number 
of requirements that may put pressure on them to 
apply for Russian passports. It further exposes certain 
categories of residents to risks of deportation or 
forcible transfers.
Incidents of violence against members and supporters 
of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (“UOC”) increased 
"during the reporting period. Moreover, several "
regional councils banned the activities of the UOC.
CIVILIAN CASUALTIES
"From 1 February to 30 April 2023, the United "
Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine 
"(HRMMU) recorded 2,037 civilian casualties in the "
"country1. They included:-  49 1 persons killed (243 men, 1 55 women, 1 2 boys "
"and 8 girls, as well as 73 adults whose sex is not yet "
known).
" - 1,546 persons injured (568 men, 324 women, "
"42 boys and 1 8 girls, as well as 586 adults and 8 "
children whose sex is not yet known).
Men and boys represented 62.7 per cent of civilian 
casualties whose sex was known. The total number 
of civilian casualties recorded in the reporting period 
represented an 1 1 per cent decrease compared 
"with the preceding three months, during which 2,287 "
"casualties were recorded, with 590 persons killed "
"and 1,697 injured."
“We often have shelling first and air 
"sirens after,”"
–  a man in Kharkiv region about the conditions in 
Ukrainian settlements affected by hostilities. 
"During the reporting period, 86 per cent of all "
civilian casualties occurred in 23 1 settlements under 
"Government control (4 10 civilians killed and 1,338 "
"injured), while 1 4 per cent happened in 28 settlements "
in areas occupied by the Russian Federation (8 1 
civilians killed and 208 injured).
The vast majority of civilian casualties (449 persons 
"killed and 1,405 injured, or 9 1 per cent) were "
caused by the use of explosive weapons with wide 
"area effects, including shelling from heavy artillery, "
"multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS), missiles and "
"air strikes, in populated areas. Although the number "
of civilian casualties caused by explosive weapons 
with wide area effects decreased from February to 
"April 2023, an increase in missile and MLRS strikes "
at the end of April led to multiple civilian casualties. 
UPDATE ON THE HUMAN RIGHTS 
SITUATION IN UKRAINE
1 February — 30 April 2023
"2In one deadly incident on 28 April 2023, a missile "
"hit a residential building in Uman, in Cherkasy region, "
"killing 24 civilians (1 2 women, 5 men, 3 girls and 3 "
boys) and injuring 1 8 more. At least seven families lost 
two members in this single missile attack.
 
Another 42 civilians were killed and 1 4 1 injured as a 
result of explosive remnants of war and mine-related 
incidents (9 per cent).2  The majority of these casualties 
occurred while civilians were walking or driving in non-
"urban areas, working their land, or repairing civilian "
infrastructure in areas over which the Government had 
regained control last autumn. 
DAMAGE TO MEDICAL AND EDUCATIONAL 
FACILITIES
"During the reporting period, HRMMU documented the "
destruction or damage of 1 8 healthcare establishments 
(1 3 hospitals and 5 other healthcare facilities) and 7 1 
"educational facilities (16 kindergartens, 52 schools, "
"and 3 higher education facilities). Since February 2022, "
HRMMU documented the damage and destruction 
of 354 medical establishments and 72 1 educational 
facilities. The actual numbers are likely substantially 
higher. The scope of destruction and damage have 
"left people without adequate access to health care, "
"especially in conflict-affected areas, and hundreds "
of thousands of children without access to in-person 
schooling.
CONFLICT-RELATED SEXUAL VIOLENCE 
"From February to April 2023, HRMMU documented "
25 cases of conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) committed by members of Russian armed forces and 
"Russian penitentiary staff against 16 men, 8 women "
"and one girl. These cases occurred in Donetsk, "
"Kharkiv, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions and in "
the Russian Federation between March and October 
"2022. In most of the cases, different types of sexual "
violence were used as a form of torture to seek to 
"obtain information or a confession, to punish, or to "
intimidate men and women in detention settings. 
Sexual violence against men (ten prisoners of war and 
six civilians) committed by Russian armed forces and 
Russian penitentiary staff (in the Russian Federation) 
"consisted of electrocution and beatings to genitals, "
"forced nudity, beatings or tasering after the shower, "
or threats of sexual violence against the victims or 
their loved ones. Sexual violence against women 
(two prisoners of war and four civilians) committed 
by Russian law enforcement and penitentiary staff 
consisted generally of electrocution by attaching 
"wires to nipples, forced nudity, stripping in the "
"presence of men guards, making victims use a toilet in "
"the presence of a man, or threats of sexual violence. "
HRMMU also documented three cases of sexual 
violence committed by members of the Russian armed 
forces against two women and one girl in residential 
areas of Donetsk region.
"During the reporting period, HRMMU also received "
credible allegations of threats of sexual violence 
against two women by members of the Ukrainian 
armed forces and Security Service of Ukraine.
RUSSIAN DECREE ON THE STATUS OF 
RESIDENTS OF OCCUPIED TERRITORY
"On 27 April 2023, the President of the Russian "
Federation signed a decree purporting to provide 
that people residing in the occupied areas of 
"Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Donetsk and Luhansk regions "
would retroactively be considered “foreigners” as 
"of 30 September 2022, unless they had obtained "
Russian citizenship.3  The decree makes a distinction 
between Ukrainian citizens whose residence is 
"registered in Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Donetsk "
"and Luhansk regions, and Ukrainian citizens "
whose residence is registered in other regions of 
Ukraine4.  The decree explicitly recognises the right 
of Ukrainian citizens with residence registration in 
occupied territory (obtained prior to the occupation) 
to continue living there without risk of deportation 
"or forcible transfer, even if they refused to obtain "
"Russian citizenship.5  However, it establishes a "
number of restrictions on Ukrainian citizens without 
Russian passports and whose residence is registered 
elsewhere. These Ukrainian citizens must apply for 
a residence permit from the occupation authorities 
or face risk of deportation or forcible transfer out 
"of the occupied territory, starting from 1 July 2024. "
3Deportations or forcible transfers of such protected 
persons would constitute a violation of international 
"humanitarian law, regardless of motive.6 "
“This is the territory of the Russian 
"Federation and, according to "
"Russian laws, we can do whatever "
we want to protect the constitutional 
"order,”"
–  an FSB officer to a man protesting about the 
arbitrary arrest of his wife in Kherson region.
"Moreover, the decree also provides that all residents without "
"Russian passports, regardless of the place of their residence "
"registration, must comply with various administrative "
procedures and reporting requirements to continue 
"residing and working in occupied territory. For instance, "
all companies and individuals who have employees must 
inform the Russian authorities about any employee who does 
"not have a Russian passport, which may be discriminatory. "
"When taken as a whole, these measures exert de facto "
"pressure on Ukrainian citizens to obtain Russian passports, "
contrary to the rules of the international law of occupation.7
MOVEMENTS OR RELOCATIONS OF CIVILIANS
"During the reporting period, HRMMU documented "
"four incidents, which took place in October and November 2022, during which that at least 294 "
"residents, including 28 children, were transferred from "
long-term care facilities located in the occupied areas 
of Kherson region to other parts of Russian-occupied 
territory or deported to the Russian Federation. 
These incidents may amount to forcible transfers 
or deportations. The individuals have since faced 
"difficulties reuniting with their loved ones, including "
lack of financial means or other necessary assistance 
"to undertake lengthy travel, as well as restrictions on "
"their freedom of movement. In some cases, Russian "
authorities withheld their identity documents or did not 
allow them to leave the facilities to which they had 
been transferred. They also treated some persons with 
intellectual and psychosocial disabilities as lacking 
legal capacity and thus unable to make decisions for 
themselves. Those among this last group who did not 
have family members in Ukraine able to travel to the 
Russian Federation to pick them up remained effectively 
"unable to leave the Russian Federation. In some cases, "
Russian authorities imposed citizenship on people 
deported or forcibly transferred from long-term care 
institutions in Ukraine to long-term care institutions in 
the Russian Federation. International humanitarian 
"law prohibits forcible transfers and deportations, and "
only permits evacuations in strict circumstances which 
require an occupying power to return any evacuated 
persons back to their homes as soon as conditions 
permit.8  It further requires an occupying power to 
"take specific measures concerning children, including "
"providing information to their family, taking measures "
"to facilitate their return, and refraining from changing "
their personal status.9  
""
4Children in institutional care were transferred by Russian 
occupation authorities to the Autonomous Republic of 
"Crimea, occupied by the Russian Federation (“Crimea”) "
"without the consent of their parents, or without the "
"parents being informed. In one case, the mother of a "
16-year-old boy with an intellectual disability learned 
on social media that her son had been transferred by 
Russian occupation authorities from a long-term care 
"facility in Oleshky, an occupied town of Kherson region, "
"to Crimea, in early November 2022. To reunite with "
"her son, she was asked to pick him up in person, but she "
could not afford the trip to Crimea via third countries 
and the Russian Federation. She was eventually able to 
travel and reunite with her son in March 2023 with the 
help of a Ukrainian non-governmental organization. 
Older people who were not institutionalised but 
evacuated from occupied territory to the Russian 
Federation also faced barriers returning to Ukraine or 
reuniting with their families in third countries. Some of 
them were accommodated in poor conditions without 
adequate access to medical services. Due to their age 
"and lack of access to digital tools, they frequently had "
difficulties obtaining information about their rights or the 
"procedures undertaken on their behalf, which in some "
cases involved the involuntary imposition of Russian 
citizenship.
FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT 
"The only crossing point across the frontline in Vasylivka, "
"Zaporizhzhia region, has remained closed by the "
Russian occupation authorities since December 2022. 
The absence of official crossing points resulted in families being separated and people being unable 
to collect their Ukrainian social security allowances 
and pensions. Civilians wishing to travel from the 
"occupied parts of Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Donetsk "
and Luhansk regions to the territory of Ukraine under 
Government control could only do so through the 
Russian Federation. The trip is not only expensive 
"(around US$400 per person), but it also involves "
"going through a so-called ‘filtration’ process, a system "
of security checks and personal data collection that has 
led to individuals being arbitrarily detained. HRMMU 
also documented many cases of men and women who 
were arbitrarily detained or forcibly disappeared by 
the Russian occupation authorities while trying to cross 
the administrative boundary line between mainland 
Ukraine and Crimea. 
TREATMENT OF PRISONERS OF WAR
"During the reporting period, HRMMU continued to "
document cases of summary executions of prisoners 
of war (POWs).10  In two videos that appeared online 
"on 6 March and 1 1 April 2023, members of the Russian "
armed forces were depicted torturing and summarily 
"executing two Ukrainian POWs. In the first video, "
Russian servicemen were depicted shooting dead a 
Ukrainian POW after he had said “Glory to Ukraine”. 
"In the second video, a Russian serviceman was filmed "
while beheading a Ukrainian serviceman. Following 
"its own review, HRMMU has reasonable grounds to "
believe that both videos were authentic. Deliberate 
commission of such acts amounts to a grave breach of 
the Geneva Conventions and constitutes a war crime.
""
5In an audio recording that emerged on social 
"media on 23 April 2023, an alleged member of the "
Ukrainian armed forces was heard ordering the killing 
"of a POW from the Wagner Group.  In response, "
"on the same day, the head of the Wagner Group11 "
indicated that his military and security contractors 
would kill all combatants and no longer take POWs 
on the battlefield. HRMMU is concerned that such 
statements risk provoking or encouraging the summary 
executions of POWs or persons hors de combat. 
"The summary execution of POWs, ordering such "
"executions, and the declaration of no quarter amount "
to grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and 
constitute war crimes.
Several POW exchanges took place from February 
"to April 2023. As a result, 6 1 8 Ukrainian POWs (594 "
men and 24 women) and 3 civilian men who had 
been captured by Russian armed forces were returned 
by the Russian Federation. The Ministry of Defence 
of the Russian Federation reported that 294 Russian 
POWs were returned by Ukraine during the reporting 
"period. Additionally, on 24 March, the Coordination "
Headquarters on Treatment of POWs (Ukraine) 
reported the unilateral repatriation of nine severely 
"wounded POWs to the Russian Federation, consistent "
with article 109 of the Third Geneva Convention. 
"On 3 April 2023, the Russian Federation unilaterally "
"returned ten Ukrainian POWs, three of them severely "
"wounded, as well as two severely wounded civilians."
SITUATION OF THE UKRAINIAN ORTHODOX 
CHURCH 
"During the reporting period, the Government and local "
authorities took several measures targeting the Ukrainian 
Orthodox Church (UOC). Authorities notably searched 
"places of worship and other UOC facilities,12  issued "
"notices of suspicions against clergymen, and placed "
"several of them under house arrest, including one of "
"the UOC’s main hierarchs.13  In addition, the Ministry "
of Culture terminated early the rental agreement with 
the UOC of the State-owned Kyiv Pechersk Lavra. 
"Following UN advocacy, authorities refrained from "
taking actions that risked violence and did not forcibly 
evict the UOC from the Lavra on the stated deadline for 
leaving the premises of 29 March.14
"During the month of April 2023, the city and regional "
"councils in Khmelnytskyi, Rivne, and Volyn banned the "
"“activities of the UOC” in their respective areas, after "
"the regional councils in Lviv, Zhytomyr, Vinnytsia and "
"Ternopil had done the same, even though such bans "
were beyond their authority. Many local councils 
also sought to terminate municipal property rental 
agreements with the UOC. HRMMU is concerned 
that the cumulative impact of Government actions 
"targeting the UOC could be discriminatory.Moreover, HRMMU documented a surge in hate "
speech and several incidents of violence against 
"UOC members in April 2023. Public officials, "
bloggers and opinion leaders used discriminatory 
and inflammatory rhetoric and openly incited violence 
against clergymen and supporters of the UOC. The 
Government and law enforcement authorities did 
not effectively address the incidents of hate speech 
during the reporting period.
IMF AGREEMENT AND SOCIAL PROTECTION
"On 3 1 March 2023, the International Monetary "
Fund approved a new 48-month Extended Fund 
Facility arrangement for Ukraine.15  As part of the 
"agreement, the Government of Ukraine committed "
to undertake substantial changes to pension 
"and social safety nets, including by improving "
“targeting and means-testing mechanisms for social 
"assistance”,16  such as utility subsidies and financial "
support to low-income households.
“My house was destroyed by 
hostilities with all documents inside. 
I spent three monthly pensions to 
"restore the property documents, but "
still don’t know whether it would 
"help to get any compensation,”"
–  a 63-year-old woman residing in an IDP shelter in 
Kyiv region.
It also committed to maintain social expenses no 
lower than an indicative target of UAH 499.6 
billion (US$1 3.5 billion) by 3 1 December 2023. 
HRMMU welcomes the review of social safety 
"nets, as social assistance remains inadequate for "
"large segments of the population, in particular "
persons with disabilities and older persons. 
"However, targeting mechanisms may still not "
"effectively reach the most vulnerable, since "
many people in need do not have the necessary 
"documents (unemployment certificates, income "
"statements, property documents, etc.) to "
satisfy existing administrative requirements. For 
"instance, people cannot receive unemployment "
certificates if they have not recently worked in 
the formal economy. Any reform should therefore 
focus on enhancing access to adequate social 
security for all by ensuring that administrative 
requirements do not constitute undue obstacles 
"for people, notably those in the most vulnerable "
situations. 
6PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES
"According to a Governmental decree, public "
associations of persons with disabilities provide social 
services aimed at the integration of persons with 
"disabilities into society.17  However, the 2023 social "
security budget dedicated to these associations fell 
significantly short of what was needed for Ukraine 
to make progress on the de-institutionalisation of 
persons with disabilities.18  Although the Ministry of 
Social Policy calculated that it needed 1 1 9 million 
"UAH for this budget line, less than 5 million UAH "
were allocated for this purpose in the 2023 budget. 
"Moreover, even though their living costs are higher "
"than those of the general population19,  people with "
disabilities receive social benefits lower than other 
types of social assistance for people considered able 
to work.20  This constitutes a form of discrimination 
against persons with disabilities.
CRIMEA 
"During the reporting period, occupation authorities "
continued to prosecute individuals for publicly 
“discrediting” and “obstructing” Russian armed 
"forces, in breach of Russian law.21  In March 2023, "
the scope of these offences was further broadened 
to encompass “actions… discrediting volunteer 
"formations, organizations or individuals who perform "
"tasks for the armed forces”, which would include "
military and security contractors and other private 
"formations. In addition, the criminal punishment was "
"increased from 3 to 5, and 5 to 7 , years in prison, "
depending on the offence.22
"“I understand your situation, but "
there is nothing I can do - my hands 
"are tied,”"
–   a judge of the Supreme Court in Crimea to a victim 
convicted of “discrediting the Russian armed forces” 
after posting a “no war” post on social media. 
"By 30 April 2023, HRMMU documented 4 "
criminal prosecutions (all against men) and 1 9 1 
administrative prosecutions (against 1 20 men and 7 1 
women) for the offences of “public actions” directed 
at “discrediting” and “obstructing” Russian armed 
forces. An overwhelming majority – 1 93 prosecutions 
"out of 1 95 – resulted in convictions, against 1 23 "
men and 70 women. HRMMU is concerned that the 
amended legislation will lead to more prosecutions 
in breach of international standards and further 
constrain the ability of Crimean residents to freely 
"express their opinions, particularly those which might "
be considered critical of the armed attack by the 
Russian Federation against Ukraine.Russian authorities continued to intimidate and harass 
"Crimean human rights defenders, including lawyers "
officially admitted to practice law.23  On 20 March 
"2023, after over six months of litigation, a local court "
in Simferopol disbarred two prominent Crimean 
"Tatar human rights lawyers, one man and one "
"woman, who are well known and respected for their "
legal representation of Ukrainian citizens charged 
with terrorism and extremism in Crimea and the 
Russian Federation.24  The disbarment order was the 
culmination of a prolonged campaign of intimidation 
and harassment that appears to be in retaliation for 
their lawful professional activities.25  The disbarment 
"of both lawyers, who have played a pivotal role in "
"advocating for justice, undermines the protection of "
human rights on the peninsula.
APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF UKRAINE ON 
COLLABORATION ACTIVITIES 
Ukrainian law enforcement authorities continued to 
open new criminal cases against individuals accused 
of collaboration with the Russian Federation under 
"article 1 1 1-1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, a "
law not complying with international human rights 
"and humanitarian law.26  As of 3 May 2023, 5,204 "
criminal proceedings had been opened under this 
"article. Members of law enforcement agencies, "
parliamentary representatives and prosecutors have 
acknowledged deficiencies of the law and the need 
"to amend it. Since its adoption on 3 March 2022, "
at least nine draft laws amending article 1 1 1-1 of 
the Criminal Code of Ukraine were registered with 
Parliament. 
HRMMU notes that efforts to amend the law should 
bring it in line with international standards. The law 
risks far-reaching impacts not only on the human rights 
"of people living in occupied territory, but also on "
social cohesion throughout Ukraine. Its extensive use 
risks ostracising and stigmatising Ukrainian citizens 
"forced to live under occupation as criminals, simply "
because they continued to perform activities essential 
"to maintain a normal life. This, in turn, could significantly "
impact the Government’s reintegration efforts.

"immediately started talking about sexual violence:against Ukrainian refugees in the border regions and inthe countries in which they found temporary shelter, butalso in the warzone back in Ukraine. At the time therewere only few indications pointing to this form ofviolence in Ukraine. But in the past weeks the subject hasbecome more and more visible. We believe it isimportant and necessary that sexual violence receivesthis attention. At the same time, however, we are worriedabout the ways this violence is being represented. Whospeaks about it and who remains silent? Which aspectsare brought forward and what remains in the dark? Inorder to share some of our observations and concerns,we decided to document some of our conversations inwritten form. The result is a momentary snapshot in anongoing development. Nevertheless, we hope tocontribute to a better understanding.

" Marta Havryshko:I think we can observe something right now that we haveseen in many wars throughout history: All over the worldsoldiers commit sexual violence along with other kind ofcrimes and atrocities such as looting, beatings, torture, andmurder. And Russian soldiers have a long record of sexualcrimes ‒ during World War II, in Afghanistan, during theChechen Wars and during the invasion of Donbas in 2014.Now in the occupied Ukrainian territories, they also commitrape and other forms of sexual violence. The majority ofvictims are women, but girls, boys, and men also su!erfrom this form of violence. In most of the cases sexualviolence is directed against civilians, but there are alsoreports that female soldiers are falling victim to sexualtorture.Most of the rapes we are seeing in this war up to today are“public rapes.” What do I mean by that? That family membersor other people who are sheltering at a place—for examplein houses, basements, or schools—are forced to witness thevictims’ humiliation. For the perpetrators it seems to be veryimportant to demonstrate to others what they can do.Hence, one aim of these “public” rapes seems to be tointimidate the Ukrainian population, to spread fear andterror—not only to the ones that actually experience thesehorrors but also to the people who witness them and hearabout them. They are sending a message to the wholecommunity: “We are powerful, we can and will punish youfor your resistance against us, for not celebrating us as‘liberators.’” Also, these rapes communicate to Ukrainianmen that they cannot protect women and children, that theycannot protect their wives, daughters, sisters, mothers.What is more, these kinds of rapes say a lot about theperpetrators themselves: They express their feeling ofcontempt for Ukraine, for the Ukrainian people. In fact, theyseem to be a way for Russian soldiers to justify their actions.RUSSIA SEXUALITY SOVIET UNION TRUMP UKRAINE WAR ZELENSKYY ZIMMERER"

"I heard about cases in which Russian soldiers enteredprivate houses, tied the women who were there to thefurniture and forced them to watch their children beingraped. In one case the older sister of a girl approached theRussian soldiers and asked them: “Please take me instead ofher. I am older.” But the soldiers replied: “No. You shouldwatch what we are doing to your sister. Because we will dothe same to all Nazi whores.” This story reveals the impact ofRussian propaganda. This propaganda says that there is agenocide by Ukrainian neo-Nazis against Russian-speakingpeople in Ukraine, and that the Russians came to protectand save all Russian speakers. This ridiculous identiﬁcationof Ukrainians with Nazis impacts the Russian soldiers’behavior and their cruelty towards Ukrainian civilians. Theyuse this propagandist language when they justify theiractions. For them, Ukrainian women are fascist women, theyare wives, daughters, sisters of fascist men. Through therapes they a!rm and strengthen this idea. Through therapes the Ukrainian women become the enemy ‘Other.’And the Russian army command condones their behavior.The soldiers are looting, they take many things, jewelry andﬂat screen TVs, and also clothes, even worthless rags. This isa sign that their morale is very low. And in the same spiritthey also rape women. And their commanders allow them toloot and to rape. Sexual violence is a reward for the soldiers,to lift their mood.In short, I believe that in this sexual violence in warfare is aweapon. Why? Because ﬁrst of all we have a lot oftestimonies of rape in all of the Russian occupied territories.These are not only individual actions. Second, most of thosecases of rapes are public rapes. The soldiers want to spreadterror, they want to spread fear. Third, it is obvious thatthose soldiers don’t believe that they will be punished. Thearmy command tolerates their actions. Even though Russiao!cially denies everything. Regina Mühlhäuser:20/06/2024, 00:53Page 5 of 23"
"What you describe shows that rape is not a “by-product” ofthis war, but an intrinsic part of the belligerent action.However, I think it is necessary to emphasize that there arerisks in using the term “rape as a weapon of war” nowadays.Because di#erent people—depending on context andinterests—mean very di#erent things by it.For instance, in TimeTime magazine, British MP Alicia Kearns(who advocates for an independent body to investigatesexual violence in Ukraine and other wars) argued that“low-ranking and mid-ranking commanders […] order theirmen to commit rape.” Where does she get this from? Whatis her evidence for this assumption? Research on other warsindicates that sexual violence is usually not explicitlyordered. Regarding the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 1992to 1995, for example, there was and is the widespreadperception that Serb commanders explicitly ordered theirmen to rape. To date, however, there is no evidence of that.Rather, the sources suggest that the ways militarycommanders treat this kind of violence—how and why it istolerated, accepted, facilitated and encouraged, and howit becomes part of military calculations—is much morecomplicated. It is thus very di!cult to hold commandersaccountable.2What I want to emphasize is that using the term “rape as aweapon of war” runs the risk of simplifying and thusmystifying why soldiers commit sexual violence. Sexualviolence appears to be condemned only insofar as it is partof a larger military plan. The fact that many soldiers maysimply be taking advantage of the opportunity is notreﬂected in the “weapon of war” narrative. The wholecomplexity of the phenomenon—how gendered dynamics,individual bodily and psychological realities, societal andcultural conditions, political and economic structuresgenerate, foster and shape the perpetration and theexperience of sexual violence—becomes invisible. 20/06/2024, 00:53Page 6 of 23"
"Marta Havryshko:I see your concern. And, indeed, I have not seen anyevidence that indicates that the Russian army commandexplicitly orders their men to rape. But I believe that theyturn a blind eye. For instance, we know of a case in Buchawhere 25 women and girls aged 14 to 24 were held in sexualslavery in the basement of a building for several days. Wemust assume that the soldiers could not have sexuallyenslaved these women without their commanders knowing.They were surely aware of this and they tolerated it.This can also be observed with regard to other crimes. Forexample, when the Russian army shells maternity hospitals,kindergartens, and schools. There are many stories ofpeople who were victimized when they attempted to runaway. There is one case when Russian soldiers opened ﬁreon a civilian vehicle near Nova Kakhovka. The family insideconsisted of ﬁve people, including a 6 year old girl and a 1.5months old boy. All of them were killed. And we know aboutsimilar cases in other regions. This type of a crime could notbe so widespread if Russian commanders are not toleratingit. And sexual violence falls in line with all of these otherbrutalities.At ﬁrst the Russians denied everything. They even deniedthat these crimes were committed by their army. “It’s a lie,”Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters at the endof March. But we have a lot of evidence. And this evidencereveals the brutality of Russian warfare. The mass graves inBucha where hundreds of civilians were killed serve as justone of many examples. As of today, as we speak, the Russianarmy has killed approximately 200 children in Ukraine, andhundreds have been injured.  Also, children’s bodies havebeen discovered, nine years old, ten years old, half-naked orcompleted naked, with their hands bound, their genitalsmutilated.What is more, sexual violence is not only directed at civilians.On 2 April, ﬁfteen Ukrainian female soldiers were liberated20/06/2024, 00:53Page 7 of 23"
"from Russian captivity. And they related how they survivedsexualized torture in detention: Their heads were shavedand they were forced to undress and do squats in front oftheir male counterparts.And when I see all of these di#erent cases I think that itreveals that sexual violence is one of the uno!cial strategiesof the Russian army to spread terror and fear, to makeUkrainians give up, to force Ukrainian authorities to agree toany Russian terms of surrender in order to put a stop tothese unspeakable horrors. The Russian army uses thiscruelty and brutality in order to scare, terrorize and,ultimately, to pacify the Ukrainian people, and to break ourcollective will for resistance. In this sense I speak aboutsexual violence as a weapon of war. Regina Mühlhäuser:When I listen to you, the old question comes to my mind:Why is sexual violence such an e#ective means to terrorize apopulation, especially in comparison to other forms ofviolence? Researchers have argued that this is related to thefact that this violence disrupts the family and the society,that it sows mistrust and leads to an alienation of partners,families, and social groups.To this day, the idea that women who have been raped are‘dishonored’ and ‘deﬁled’ is very common. As Gaby Zipfel hasnoted, rape victims are often accused of being complicit intheir own victimization. For instance, it is suggested that “sheasked for it” or that “she would never admit it, but secretlyshe did enjoy it.” As a consequence, the victim is deniedsympathy and a clear classiﬁcation of this form of violenceas crime.Only when the perpetration of sexual violence is extremelybrutal and is accompanied by other forms of violence is itunambiguously established as an unwanted, negative20/06/2024, 00:53Page 8 of 23"
"experience and as a war crime. By implication, we must thusask ourselves whether most of the stories of sexual violencethat are publicly told right now are so gruesome preciselybecause there is no doubt that they will clearly beunderstood as crimes. And then we must further askourselves whether there might be less “spectacular” cases ofrape happening right now—that is, cases that are notaccompanied by this horriﬁc excessive violence—which thevictims cannot report because they must fear beingsuspected of complicity. Marta Havryshko:I am sure there are many things going on right now that wedon’t know about, that will only come to light later, after theend of this war, or perhaps never.But let me stress your ﬁrst question: Why is this violence soparticularly e#ective? I think we can already see that thisviolence causes mistrust in Ukrainian society. And this alsohas something to do with the prewar period. Rape culturewas and is heavily present in Ukrainian society, as in manyother societies around the world. Before the war, we werenot very open to speak about sexual violence in the publicsphere. For example, when the #MeToo movement started,many public ﬁgures in Ukraine, such as famous writers,began poking fun of the women who spoke up. And whenwe had our own ﬂash mob #IamNotAfraidToSpeak, wefeminists were astonished by the reactions of many menwho mocked the women who chose to reveal their stories ofabuse and trauma. Indeed, we are lacking a substantial,open discussion about sexual violence in di#erent spheresof life—in academia, in schools, in church, in the armedforces and so on. It therefore does not come as any surprisewhen we currently observe in social media that every postabout a case of sexual violence in the Russian occupiedterritories has dozens of comments by ordinary people whoengage in victim blaming: “What did you expect? You didn’t20/06/2024, 00:53Page 9 of 23"
"you leave the territory …” “What did you expect? You didn’thide your daughters …” “What did you expect? You let theminto your house and brought them tea …” Sadly, there is a lotof victim blaming going around right now.There is a recent story published by a feminist journalist,Victoria Kobyliatska, who spoke to a woman who wasraped. This woman lives in a small village in the countrysideand she told Kobyliatska that she would not go to the policeor apply for psychological support. Her main worry is thatshe is pregnant as a result of the rape and that she wants toterminate her pregnancy. She blames herself for notresisting the perpetrator, even though experts say that it’s anormal reaction in a violent situation and, in fact, a survivalstrategy, because the victim can never know what theo#ender will do to her and her beloved ones in they put upany resistance. So it is even harder to see that this womansuspects that the people in her local community might notsupport her but, rather, might even question her behavior.Some women also report that other women tell them how tobehave in order to avoid rape by Russian soldiers: “Youshould hide, you should wear rags, you should smear yourface and body with feces, you should pretend you are mador you should pretend that you are sick.” This actuallyreminds me of women in World War II. For my project ongender and violence during the Holocaust in Ukraine, Iconducted many interviews with eye-witnesses. One of myrespondents told me: “When the Germans started to rapewomen, some older women refused to go to theunderground shelters. They put on very old, dirty clothesand they screamed ‘krank, krank’ [sick, sick].” And nowadayssome women make oral statements, sometimes evenwritten notes, on how to behave in situations of war-relatedsexual violence which sound quite similar. As a matter offact, this also creates an atmosphere in which victim blamingis justiﬁed and even encouraged. “If you follow some basicrules,” the logic appears to be saying, “you will not be raped.But if you are raped, you should question your behavior.”These women are traumatized, but they cannot speakopenly about it, because they must assume that even their20/06/2024, 00:53Page 10 of 23"
"relatives and their friends will blame them, at least partially. Regina Mühlhäuser:I never thought about it in this way. When I studied thesekinds of stories in World War II, I always thought about suchmeasures as a method for women and girls to protectthemselves, and in that sense as empowering actions. Butyou are right: At the same time, this also insinuates that it isthe responsibility of the victims to prevent rape. Marta Havryshko:Feminists in Ukraine are trying to deal with this problem ofvictim-blaming. For instance, some feminist journalistsrecently wrote an article focusing on the question of howto investigate and represent sexual violence in the media,how to approach victims-survivors, how to lead theconversation with them, and how to avoid using theseallegedly “hot topics,” which are only intended to illustratetheir own views and interests anyway. They ask all journaliststo think about the victims as they would their loved ones.Also, some human rights organizations have developedleaﬂets for victims of sexual violence: What can you do if youare pregnant? What medicine can you take if you contracteda sexually transmitted disease? Their recommendations arevery practical, developed and presented in a sensitivemanner. Furthermore, those leaﬂets also provide phonenumbers for organizations that specialize in assisting victimsof sexual violence, for women’s rights organizations, and forspecial law enforcement units. I heard that most survivorstry to seek help from established women’s rightsorganizations, because these organisations have worked onsexual violence for a very long time, and their members are20/06/2024, 00:53Page 11 of 23"
"trained well and know how to talk to the women withoutinﬂicting additional blame, shame, or fear.Indeed, not all support mechanisms for victims of sexualviolence are this professional. After the ﬁrst reports of rapebegan emerging in March, a psychological assistance servicefor victims of sexual violence was established on 1 April, withthe support of UNICEF. However, victims of sexual violencein Ukraine, by and large, have not been willing to talk tothese psychologists. And indeed, some of thesepsychologists have behaved a very unprofessional manner—for example, in revealing information about their client’sstories to the general public. Consequently, rape victims areafraid that they will be identiﬁed by their relatives or friends.As many victims of sexual violence had to leave their homesin eastern Ukraine and ﬂed to western Ukraine, there is anincreasing demand for support in this latter region rightnow. In Lviv, for instance, the women’s rightsorganisation “Women’s Perspectives” organizes workshopsfor training psychologists on how to speak with victims ofsexual violence.But we also observe additional problems. Some Ukrainianrape victims have ﬂed the country and are now in Poland.But in Poland you cannot easily get the “morning after pill” inthe pharmacy. What is more, abortion became largelyillegal after a ruling of the Polish Constitutional Court inJanuary 2021. Since then, you may terminate yourpregnancy when you are raped, but only if you have ﬁled apolice complaint. Most Ukrainian war refugees, however, donot report what happened to them. Last but not least, theydon’t have enough strength to deal with all the legalquestions. There are also some feminist initiatives thathelp with organizing abortions, but it is not always easy forUkrainian survivors to get access. This can be a horriblesituation for many victims. For one thing, there are womenwho are afraid of the discrimination that awaits them whenthey bring home an “illegitimate” child. They are afraid thattheir husbands, families and communities will learn that theyhave been raped, and that they might be ashamed and20/06/2024, 00:53Page 12 of 23"
"direct their anger against them, not against the perpetrators.In addition, some women might also fear that they will notbe able to feel love for this child, that they will not be able tobehave like a caring mother. Indeed, when a woman bears achild conceived after rape, she is faced with many negativeemotions and memories. Regina Mühlhäuser:The situations in which victims of sexual violence ﬁndthemselves is terrible and di!cult in itself, under “normal”circumstances, but even more so in an ongoing militaryconﬂict. What are the conditions under which those who area#ected can relate and discuss their experiences right now?Do women share their stories with their friends, in feministcircles, via social media? Do they report what happened tothem? Marta Havryshko:Some women share stories about their own experiences aswell as the experiences of others with people they trust, inparticular with other women: family members, friends,women that host them in their homes or support and assistthem, and sometimes even with strangers. For example, mymother, who lives near Lviv, meets a lot of internallydisplaced persons. Among them are women who openly talkabout sexual violence in the Russian-controlled territories.Other women prefer to use indirect speech, saying, forinstance: “I had to leave Bucha because I have twodaughters,” thereby conveying that they wanted to savethem from rape.Some women who experienced sexual violence also reportto o!cial bodies like the Ukrainian police. And most of the20/06/2024, 00:53Page 13 of 23"
"information that is made public comes from Ukrainiano!cial bodies—the Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner forHuman Rights, Lyudmyla Denisova, the Prosecutor General,Iryna Venediktova, and the local authorities. Some cases aredescribed by Ukrainian and foreign media outlets. And inaddition, evidence is collected and revealed by NGOs, suchas Human Rights Watch. Still we must assume that many ofthe victims prefer to remain silent and that this violence isstill underreported. Regina Mühlhäuser:If we assume that many of those who are victims of sexualviolence perpetrated by Russian soldiers are not authorizedto speak, that they might feel it is safer for them to remainsilent, then we must also assume that the situation is evenmore precarious for women who have experienced sexualviolence in other constellations, i.e. where the perpetratorswere not Russian soldiers. We know this from other wars, forexample in the former Yugoslavia or in Rwanda. GoranaMlinarević has recounted that a ‘Croatian’ woman who wasraped by a ‘Serbian’ man and a ‘Serbian’ woman who wasraped by a ‘Croatian’ man can feel solidarity and support foreach other. But if a woman was raped by a man from herown group, she can hardly count on receiving any solidaritywithin her group. These kinds of cases are actively silenced.3Do you see similar problems in Ukraine? Marta Havryshko:Yes, and I do think it is necessary to monitor all the di#erentconstellations of sexual violence in order to understandwhat is going on. For instance, when the war started, somecases were made public where civilian men had sexuallyassaulted women in bomb shelters. But nobody wants to20/06/2024, 00:53Page 14 of 23"
"hear those stories, no media will provide any space to reﬂecton them. People who try to publish them independently willbe accused of working for the enemy, of dragging down ourspirits … I believe that this will be another consequence ofthis war, that some women will be silenced, because theirstories do not ﬁt into the hegemonic narrative, that is, thatthe rapist is always the enemy soldier.In fact, we also know about cases of sexual violence byUkrainian soldiers. In the conﬂict in Donbas, since 2014,some cases where Ukrainian soldiers sexually assaulted andraped local women have been made public. For example,some members of the infamous “Tornado Unit” wereaccused of rape and other crimes in 2016. But lawyers andhuman rights activists noted that Ukraine is not verysuccessful at trying and convicting its own militiamen,despite there being plenty of opportunity to do so. It seemsas if some judicial bodies consider the fact that thedefendants fulﬁlled their military duty in Donbas as amitigating circumstance. This was, for instance, the casewhen a war veteran who was charged with the rape of ateenage girl in Kyiv was sentenced only to two years ofsuspended imprisonment and a small ﬁne (3,000 hryvnias,approximately 100 Euro).In addition, similar to other armies around the world, we canalso see in the Ukrainian army that female soldiers su""erfrom sexual harassment and violence by their malecomrades, and face huge di!culties when seeking justice.But all of these constellations don’t receive any attention—they are silenced, and I am afraid that the groups andagencies that are now beginning to document sexualviolence in this war will only look for cases of sexual violenceperpetrated by Russian soldiers. Regina Mühlhäuser:20/06/2024, 00:53Page 15 of 23"
"What is speakable and what is silenced, when, and why? Inthe past years, we have often talked about the“communicative rules of sexual violence” with regard toWorld War II. Acts of sexual violence during World War IIencompassed a variety of constellations—in Europe as wellas in Asia. To begin, the perpetrators were German andJapanese soldiers or their respective allies. But, secondly,they were also members of the Allied armies—Soviet,American, British, and French soldiers—as well as membersof partisan and resistance groups. And we know that, thirdly,also civilian men, including men who belonged to the groupsthat were persecuted by the Germans and the Japanese,committed sexual crimes. Many of such acts of sexualviolence were directed against the respective enemies, butmembers of one’s own collective could also become victims.When do these constellations become a subject of publicdiscussion? Who speaks about it? Who remains silent? Andwhy? The answers to these questions always depend onpolitical conditions and interests at a certain point in time. Marta Havryshko:Yes, and I believe we can currently observe a shift takingplace in Ukraine. Do you remember when you told me thatyou gave a lecture on sexual violence by members of theWehrmacht and SS at the 2013 conference “Central and EastEuropean Women and the Second World War” in Kyiv? Atthat time, everyone thought it was a great subject, while, onthe other hand, there were disagreements about whether to,as well as how to, address sexual violence by soldiers of theSoviet army. Today, however, everybody wants to draw upparallels between the Red army soldiers of World War II andthe Russian soldiers of today. But no one wants to talk aboutthe Wehrmacht, the SS and their local collaborators in theHolocaust, i.e. Ukrainian policemen, anymore. Why? Becausemany people now see Germany as an ally. So they don’t wantto bring this to the table. I was, for instance, recently askedby Ukrainian media to give an interview about sexual20/06/2024, 00:53Page 16 of 23"
"violence in Ukraine during World War II. When they sent metheir questions, I saw that there was no single questionabout the German army or the persecution of the Jews. Allquestion were about Red Army soldiers. Regina Mühlhäuser:Interesting, I experienced something similar, but in acompletely di#erent context. I was asked in an interview forthe German news agency RND whether I thought what ishappening right now in Ukraine was comparable to WorldWar II. And I said that I don’t think such comparisons areparticularly meaningful. If I were to make a comparison,however, I would want to compare the behavior of theRussian army today with the behavior of the German army inWorld War II. Both armies made a surprise attack, invading asovereign neighboring country in violation of internationallaw, both armies conscripted very young men and so on.After this was published, I received several e-mails fromGerman men, even a university professor, accusing me ofwanting to be politically correct, but actually just being naive.Because the Russian army today, so goes their argument,would behave similarly and just as “uncivilized” as the RedArmy in World War II. Here, historically deep-rooted Germananti-Russian resentments come to the fore, for which thecurrent war simply appears as a conﬁrmation—and inparticular the perpetration of sexual violence which is seenas evidence for a particular kind of uncivilized-ness.What this illustrates is that sexual violence is a politicallycontested issue and a crucial element of memory politics.And what disappears in these processes, again and again,are the voices of the victims themselves. This is not aboutthem. They are not asked; they are not listened to. Theirstories disappear in the respective nationalist meta-narratives. 20/06/2024, 00:53Page 17 of 23"
"Marta Havryshko:Indeed, the whole debate about sexual violence in the war inUkraine right now should be more victim/survivor-centered.What we see now are e#orts to collect evidence for futuretrials to persecute the perpetrators. This is, of course, veryimportant. But what about the well-being of the survivors?That should also be a primary concern. Money andresources should be o#ered to improve their situation.I watched the UN Security Council session onaccountability for conﬂict-related sexual violence, whichwas held on 11 April 2022. Almost all speakers from all thedi#erent countries, the representative of UNICEF and so onmentioned sexual violence in Ukraine. On the one hand, it isvery good that these gendered su#erings are noted, andthat they are even discussed in terms of crimes againsthumanity and so on. The British ambassador to Ukraine,Melinda Simmons, for example, already stated on 3 Aprilthat Russian soldiers are committing rape as ‘weapon ofwar’. In fact, an initiative led by the United Kingdom wants toestablish some kind of special, independent body toinvestigate this violence in Ukraine. So this question is on thetable on di#erent political levels, which is a good thing.At the same time, however, the support for victims is reallynot well established. There is a lack of trained specialists forproviding them with psychological support, a lack ofspecialists who are trained for collecting evidence withoutretraumatizing survivors, a lack of state-run shelters for rapesurvivors and their children, and so on. I think we really needto work harder in building systems and procedures forapproaching victims, for supporting them, for providingthem with psychological and medical support. And this alsohas to do with the establishment of special types of supportfor children. You might have heard about the case of a sixyear old boy who had to watch the gang rape of his mother.He stopped talking. Kids like him also need support andassistance, because they are secondary victims of sexualviolence. What we need to do is think more about providing20/06/2024, 00:53Page 18 of 23"
"help for victims-survivors and their loved ones. Regina Mühlhäuser:I think an approach like that of Medica Mondiale—afeminist NGO that cooperates with partner organisationsin conﬂict zones in order to support and empower localwomen and support structures—is particularly instructive.Regarding the investigation e#orts, we have to keep in mindthat it will be extremely di!cult to document and prosecutethis kind of violence, even more so in the midst of anongoing war. The prosecution of sexual violence ininternational and internationalized courts in the past 20years has shown how di!cult it is to conduct suchproceedings in a way that leads to a conviction of theperpetrators and, at the same time, to protect the victim-witnesses. As Gabi Mischkowski and Gorana Milinarevićargue, the reasons for this are manifold. The ﬁrst one thatcomes to my mind is that it is di!cult to prove sexualviolence beyond doubt. This violence often takes place inprivate, without third party witnesses. Now, one might wantto object that many rapes in Ukraine are “public rapes.” Butwe have seen something similar in Bosnia Herzegovina.Here, too, “public rapes” were considered as evidence fortheir strategic function. In fact, however, not a single eyewitness was found who would testify before the ICTY.Moreover, there is usually no evidence that this violence wasordered (which, as I already mentioned above, it is usuallynot). On the contrary, the responsibility of militarycommanders is legally di!cult to establish.Another problem is how the testimonies of the victims aregenerated. Investigators are often ﬁxated on the issue ofsexual violence. But the women who testify as victim-witnesses have experienced quite a lot of things, sexualviolence being only one instance of war-related violence.20/06/2024, 00:53Page 19 of 23"
"This ﬁxation on sexual violence, and the way the interviewstake place, can thus lead to a retraumatization. In general,many people taking statements have not been trained inhow to deal with victims of sexual violence, how to protectthem, and how to conduct the interviews in a way that thestatements will hold up in court. The British Initiative for anIndependent Commission of Inquiry has announced itsintention to abide by the new Murad Code, which seeks tocreate legal standards for questioning and protectingvictims. However, this approach remains impartial andproblematic. In the drafting process there have beenfeminist critiques that the code focuses merely on theindividual situation of a survivor and “does not addressthe institutional, government, and professional reformnecessary to protect survivors from the potentiallynegative consequences of documentation.”It is also often the case that very di#erent organizations takewitness statements in the course of investigations—localNGOs, police, international investigators from di#erentcountries, and so on. Since memory is not ﬁxed, it regularlyhappens that statements contradict each other, for instancewith regard to the time of the crime or the colour of a nearbyhouse, etc. To us, these factors might not seem relevant, butcontradictions in these details make such statements uselessin a court of law.In order to deal with these and many other problems,researchers like Kirsten Campbell argue that we need toreconceptualize international criminal justice “so that ittransforms, rather than reproduces, gendered injustices.” Marta Havryshko:I share your concern. I believe that victims are likely to beexploited in the process of such investigations. In particularbecause they are traumatized not only by sexual violence,but by losing their home, losing their loved ones, etc. This is20/06/2024, 00:53Page 20 of 23"
"why we need to closely observe these documentation andprosecutorial e#orts. There should be di#erent feministgroups, and in particular local feminist groups, in Ukrainethat are involved in these investigations. And there needs tobe a mechanism that enables these groups to put pressureon investigators and prosecutors. Only then will it bepossible to have a successful outcome and to protect victimsof sexual violence. Regina Mühlhäuser is a Senior Researcher atRegina Mühlhäuser is a Senior Researcher atthe Hamburg Foundation for thethe Hamburg Foundation for theAdvancement of Research and Culture andAdvancement of Research and Culture andan Associate Researcher at the Hamburgan Associate Researcher at the HamburgInstitute for Social ResearchInstitute for Social ResearchMarta Havryshko is a Researcher at the IvanMarta Havryshko is a Researcher at the IvanKrypiakevych Institute of Ukrainian StudiesKrypiakevych Institute of Ukrainian Studiesin Lviv and a Guest Researcher at thein Lviv and a Guest Researcher at theUniversity of BaselUniversity of Basel Notes1.

INTRODUCTION 
 
"Following the aggression of the Russian Federation ag ainst Ukraine, and the subsequent decision of the "
"Committee of Ministers to exclude the Russian Federation from the Organisation, the Council of Europe "
immediately adjusted its support to Ukraine in response  to the national partners’ requests and needs. The 
Priority Adjustments to the Council of Europe Ac tion Plan for Ukraine 2018-2022 (hereinafter – the Priority 
Adjustments) were adopted by the Committee of Mini sters in Turin on 20 May and were then implemented 
"throughout 2022, thus contributing to the national re construction efforts, guided by the Government of "
"Ukraine’s National Recovery and Development Plan, ai med at rebuilding a democratic and prosperous "
"Ukraine. The Council of Europe remains fully comm itted to Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty, and "
"territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders.  The Council of Europe Action Plan for Ukrain e “Resilience, Recovery and Reconstruction” 2023 -2026 "
"(hereinafter – the Action Plan) has been prepared in close consultation with the Ukrainian authorities, as a "
response to the determination a nd resolve of Ukraine’s authorities and people to engage in rebuilding the 
"country. The proposed measures, based on Council of  Europe standards, are aimed at accompanying the "
"reconstruction process and economic recovery in Ukraine with support to strengthen the resilience of Ukrainian public institutions, to enhance democratic go vernance and the rule of law and to protect citizens’ "
fundamental rights.   
The document builds on the progress achieved by Uk raine in meeting Council of Europe standards in the 
"areas of human rights, the rule of law and democracy, notably within the previous Action Plan 2018-2022 "
and its Priority Adjustments and is aimed to contin ue supporting the country’s efforts to honour its 
"obligations as a Council of Europe member State. The Action Plan priorities take into account decisions, "
"resolutions, recommendations, report conclusions and op inions issued by the Committee of Ministers of the "
"Council of Europe (CM), the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), the Congress of "
"Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Eu rope (the Congress), the Commissioner for Human "
"Rights of the Council of Europe (the Commissioner),  the European Commission for Democracy through Law "
(Venice Commission) and other advisory and monitoring bodies of the Organisation. 
" The Action Plan is also aimed to support Ukraine’s European perspective reform agenda, following the decision by the European Council on 23 June 2022 to grant EU candidate status to Ukraine, and the "
"commitment made at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in  Lugano (Switzerland), on 4-5 July 2022, to link "
Ukraine’s European perspective and the recovery process.  
" The Council of Europe Action Plan for Ukrain e “Resilience, Recovery and Reconstruction” 2023 -2026 will "
address immediate and medium-term needs of the co untry in areas where the Council of Europe has 
expertise.  
 
While some interventions planned in the document are in  continuity with the previous co-operation in the 
"framework of the Priority Adjustments, some new ar eas have been added in agreement with Ukrainian "
authorities focusing on a lo nger-term perspective of implementation on ce the situation on the ground allows.  
 
The proposed actions were developed to delivering also on the steps outlined in the European 
"Commission's opinion on Ukraine's membership application, which recommends inter alia : enacting and "
implementing legislation on selection and appointment pr ocedures for judges of the Constitutional Court of 
Ukraine and functioning of the Court in line with the European Commission for Democracy through Law 
(Venice Commission) recommendations; further stre ngthening the fight against corruption and money-
laundering; implementation of integrity vetting procedures  for the candidates to the High Council of Justice 
and the re-establishment of the High Qualification Com mission of Judges of Ukraine; adopting a media law 
in line with the EU audio-visual media services directive and strengthening of the independent media regulator; finalising the reform of the legal framework for national minorities and establishing effective implementation mechanisms.   
The Action Plan is a result of a structured dialogue with the Ukrainian authorities and other relevant actors 
"with a view to strengthening Ukraine’ s resilience, recovery and reconstruc tion efforts in the areas of human "
"rights, rule of law and democracy in line also with the Guiding Princi ples for Ukraine’s Recovery Process "
(“Lugano Principles”).  
 This also includes a parliamentary dimension where ap propriate aimed at increasing the impact of actions 
of the Parliament and ensuring ownership  by the members of Verkhovna Rada.  
 
This support will come along with the significant in terventions by the Council of Europe Development Bank 
(CEB). The CEB can provide a relevant contribution by part-financing investment pr ojects with high social 
 3  
 added value fostering inclusion and contributing to im proving the living conditions of the most vulnerable 
groups. It has already provided support in the form of gr ants and loans to Ukraine’s neighbouring countries. 
"Co-ordination with possible interventions of the CEB will be ensured and will be reflected in future updates of the document, when Ukraine becomes a member thereof and thereby eligible for actions inside Ukraine.  "
 
"The Council of Europe action will be carefully co-ordin ated with other actors and stakeholders. In particular, "
"co-ordination with the European Union and internatio nal organisations, including United Nations agencies "
"and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), as well as with bilateral donors, will "
ensure complementarity of actions. High level meetings and the day-to-day co-ordination of activities at operational level will be complemented by the participation in thematic donor-government co-ordination 
"groups, in order to increase the impact of the Council of Europe action on the ground.  "
" The Action Plan provides a four-year framework for co-operation while offering the flexibility required to respond to evolving needs in the current volatile context and high-risk environment. As a living document, it "
will be updated as needed in line with developments in the country to adapt priorities to emerging needs. 
Risks and threats mitigation strategies and management mechanisms will be evaluated and discussed with 
the Ukrainian authorities.  
 The overall budget for the four-year co-operation framework is estimated at €50 million.  
 Progress made under the document will be jointly as sessed by the Council of Europe and the authorities of 
"Ukraine. For this purpose, a Steering Committee will be established, composed of representatives of the "
"Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other national stakeholde rs involved in the implementation of the Action Plan, "
as well as of representatives of th e Council of Europe. The Steering Com mittee will meet when the situation 
"allows, as agreed between the Council of Europe and the Ukrainian authorities.  The Council of Europe will also provide regular upda tes on the progress and ou tcomes of the document. "
Strategic and operational key performance indicators (KPI) are part of the logical framework of the Action 
"Plan allowing to measure the progress achieved toward  the priorities, objectives and timeline set in the "
document.

Introduction and Background 
Victims from Sri Lanka are largely Tamil men and 
"women, sexually violated and tortured by state security "
"forces in both legal and illegal detention settings, during "
"and after the civil war, including up to the present day.1 "
They are forced to pursue informal justice mechanisms 
because the state is still in denial about the violations and 
actually protects those responsible. As the United Nations 
"(UN) High Commissioner for Human Rights observed, “Sri "
"Lanka remains in a state of denial about the past, with truth "
seeking efforts aborted and the highest state officials refusing to 
make any acknowledgement of past crimes.”2
"Survivors have made submissions to UN bodies and international governments for sanctions, "
"visa bans, vetting, and screening, as well as being involved in the opening of universal jurisdiction "
cases and civil damages cases.3 They are supported by two projects in the United Kingdom (UK): the 
"International Truth and Justice Project (ITJP), which collects and preserves evidence to be used for litigation "
"and a range of accountability mechanisms, and Support a Survivor of Torture (SAST), a psychosocial project run "
by an associated charity. 
The following case study has been written by an independent 
"consultant on behalf of the Global Initiative for Justice, Truth and "
Reconciliation (GIJTR). This case study is informed by a combination 
"of desktop research, document analysis and interviews. It therefore "
"reflects these perspectives and findings, as compiled and written "
by the consulting author(s). Interviewees have been anonymized to 
ensure their safety and privacy but GIJTR extends its gratitude for the 
time and participation of all interviewees.ADVANCING A

A Case Study from Sri Lanka 
"Author: Frances Harrison, Yasmin Sooka and Dr Michael Korzinski"
"2In Sri Lanka, NGOs cannot openly work on "
psychosocial support for victims of conflict-
related sexual violence (CRSV). They report that 
sexual violence is characterized by shame and 
"stigmatization, given the traditional and cultural "
"context. Consequently, the extent of sexual abuse "
during the war and its final stages is so highly 
underreported.4 Sexual violence is considered to be 
"extremely sensitive, with incidents often not reported "
due to the shame involved for the victims/survivors.5 
Tamil society places female victims/survivors of 
"sexual violence in an extremely difficult position, "
given highly valued notions of chastity and virginity 
before marriage.6 The fear of social stigmatization 
and reprisals from perpetrators following such events 
has kept both male and female rape victims/survivors 
silent. Reporting sexual violence also involves a 
serious risk of reprisal against family members of 
victims.7 Researchers have suggested that much of 
"the sexual violence, along with other torture, is used "
to control the Tamil population through degradation 
"and fear, to intimidate victims and their families into "
"silence, and to extract large ransoms.8 Coupled with "
institutional hurdles in the legal system blocking 
"effective reporting and investigation, many victims "
have not reported such violations. While both men 
and women have been subjected to sexual abuse as a 
"result of the war and ongoing conflict, male victims/"
survivors are reluctant to report sexual abuse due 
to homophobia and stigmatization.9 Many people in 
Sri Lanka believe that rape and sexual abuse of men 
is not possible and that a man who has been raped 
must be weak or homosexual.10 Failure to include the 
rape of men in the Penal Code only reinforces those 
misconceptions.

METHODOLOGY
"The background research for this case study involved accessing UN, "
"NGO and academic research on the subject, as well as the ITJP’s own "
sizeable witness archive. Information regarding domestic access 
to justice was collected for the ITJP by a human rights lawyer in Sri 
"Lanka, who remains anonymous for protection reasons. An employee "
of a partner organization in Sri Lanka collected information on Sri 
"Lankan NGO activity for this report, for which primary interviews were "
"conducted with the ITJP’s survivors, a clinical supervisor, and lawyers, "
"including the ITJP executive director, a leading transitional justice expert. "
Feedback from staff and survivors involved in the ITJP’s psychosocial 
4project was also reviewed. The project involves finding ways to discuss 
CRSV and has been part of a Global Survivors Fund consultation on 
CRSV reparations for the last year.11 
COUNTRY BACKGROUND
The civil war in Sri Lanka was fought between Tamil militants and 
the state security forces for nearly three decades (1983–2009). It 
culminated in 2009 when tens of thousands of civilians were massacred 
in a matter of months and the militant group was defeated. Sri Lankan 
Tamils took up arms after being denied their basic rights by a Sinhala 
"Buddhist majoritarian state, fighting for a separate homeland. This "
"struggle involved the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), who at "
times held large parts of territory of the island and operated a parallel 
"government. The LTTE was accused of using child soldiers, forced "
"recruitment, and suicide bombers. For their part, the state security "
"forces deliberately targeted hospitals and civilians, committed mass "
"enforced disappearance, and used torture and sexual violence as part "
of a policy of repression against Tamils.12 
"Sexual violence committed by the Sri Lankan security forces has been extensively documented, "
"but the LTTE has never been found to have perpetrated CRSV.13 This is unusual, and ascribed to the "
presence of women in the LTTE movement and the need for community support. 
"The security force units involved in these violations include police, paramilitary police, counter-"
"terrorism units, the Navy, the Army, and intelligence services all assisted by pro-government Tamil "
paramilitaries.14 The perpetrators largely came from the majority Sinhala community.
POST-WAR
There are ongoing allegations of widespread sexual violence by the 
security forces against Tamils of all ages and genders with perceived 
connections to the LTTE.15 This typically occurred during unlawful 
detention and in the context of the ongoing structural violence and 
systematic targeting of the Tamil population in the north and east of 
"Sri Lanka.16 In recent years, the victims/survivors of CRSV have also "
included the next generation of young Tamil men campaigning for their 
political and human rights.17
The United Nations Investigation into Sri Lanka (OISL) described what it called shocking allegations 
of CRSV by security forces in internment and displacement camps and rehabilitation camps.18 There 
"are also reports of women having been held in military camps for the purpose of sexual slavery, "
sometimes for many years.19
"5Documented forms of CRSV include the burning of detainees’ genitals or breasts with cigarettes, "
"twisting of penises and testicles, scratching or biting of breasts and buttocks, forcible masturbation, "
"being forced to perform oral sex, spraying chili powder on genitals, crushing genitals by slamming "
"drawers on them, oral, vaginal and anal rape, including with barbed wires, and gang rape.20"
SCALE
A post-war academic study suggests that approximately 13 percent of the 
Sri Lankan population had personally experienced sexual assault during 
"the war.21 Researching in the UK in 1998, a medical practitioner, M. Peel, "
found a 21 percent prevalence rate of CRSV among male asylum seekers 
who had been sexually violated in detention while reviewing the medico-
"legal reports of 184 Sri Lankan men.22 Freedom from Torture, a UK-based "
"network of survivors of torture, consistently reports on sexual violence "
"used against men and women. In 2015, they found that 39 percent of Sri "
Lankan clients disclosed rape and 71 percent sexual torture. CRSV rates 
"were again noted in their 2019 report.23 In 2013, Human Rights Watch "
"published a report in which 41 women, 27 men, and three boys described "
having experienced sexual violence.24 The ITJP published a report in 2018 
based on the testimony of 121 male survivors of CRSV and continues to 
"interview predominantly male victims.25 In 2013, a UN study reported that "
14.5 percent of Sri Lankan men surveyed said they had raped a woman 
"(this included their wives).26 This reinforces what the UN has said, namely "
that “incidents of sexual violence were not isolated acts but part of a 
deliberate policy [in Sri Lanka].”27 
DOMESTIC LAW 
"The Penal Code, as amended in 1995, contains the most significant "
"legal protections against rape and sexual violence in Sri Lanka, with the "
Evidence Ordinance and the Code of Criminal Procedure providing the 
procedure and rules of evidence for prosecuting the offense of rape. 
"Constitutional safeguards, particularly the prohibition of torture and all "
forms of inhuman or degrading treatment and punishment under Article 
"11, also provide a formal medium of redress where rape is recognized as "
torture.28 
"Rape is defined under Section 363 of the Penal Code and applies to all victims/survivors of rape, "
including those affected by armed conflict.29 There is no specific definition or recognition of CRSV 
"in Sri Lanka or any reference in law to the international definition of the crime. Under the Penal Code, "
rape refers to forced sexual intercourse/penetration by a man of a woman without her consent.30 The 
issue of consent is deemed immaterial in circumstances where the woman is under the age of 16 
"6(statutory rape), of unsound mind, or in a state of intoxication caused by drugs or alcohol given "
"to her by the perpetrator or some other person, where the woman believes the perpetrator to "
"be her husband or where her consent is obtained through force, threats, intimidation, the fear of "
"injury and/or death, or while she is in unlawful detention.31"
"While there have been amendments to the definition of rape, they are regarded as insufficient.32 "
"Same-sex consensual relations have been criminalized, which acts as a barrier to disclosure by "
"male victims and facilitates the persecution of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex "
"(LGBTI+) people. Similarly, the prohibition of statutory rape applies only to girls, and not to boys.33"
In 2013 a UN study found that 96.5 percent of men who committed rape were not arrested or 
"jailed for their acts.34 Even when cases do reach the courts, there are chronic delays, failures in "
"the recording of medico-legal evidence, and a lack of support for victims of SGBV.35"
Prominent examples of this include a fundamental rights case brought by Yogalingam Vijitha 
"who was tortured and raped in police detention, but  ̶ despite the court ordering compensation "
"to be paid, the rapists were never prosecuted.36 A Tamil woman who was gang raped by four "
"soldiers in Vishwamadu in 2010 secured a conviction in 2015, but the soldiers were acquitted on "
appeal and the victim was forced to flee the country. 
"Innovations, Opportunities, and Challenges "
SPLIT PROGRAMMATIC APPROACH 
The ITJP and SAST’s approach to engagement with victims is twofold: 
the ITJP implements a legal documentation project and SAST an 
accompanying psychosocial support project. The two programs are 
deliberately separated to partition assistance to victims/survivors 
from the recording of their statements so as not to open the ITJP to 
accusations in any future legal proceedings that we are “rewarding” 
"witnesses and “contaminating evidence.” However, human rights law "
recognizes the right of those who suffer gross human rights violations 
to psychosocial treatment and other alleviating measures.37
The following table summarizes the two programs’ complementary engagement with victims. In 
"practice, the ITJP cannot take detailed witness statements from every victim/survivor who needs "
"assistance, so a person may enter the SAST program and never give a full statement or may give a "
statement first and then join the SAST program.

Legal Accountability - ITJP  Psychosocial Healing - SAST
Identification of witnesses 
Statement-taking by independent 
investigators who are usually UN-trained. The 
process is usually supported by independent 
medico-legal reports and supporting 
documentationSecurity screening by staff and induction 
"to the group-counselling, therapeutic art, "
"English and Art classes, lunch, and travel "
expenses.38 
Support with witness protection (referral to 
"psychosocial project, asylum support, advice "
"regarding threats to family in Sri Lanka)Physical assistance: clothes, food, medical, "
"housing, and other social service referrals, "
help with English
"Consent to share testimony with a third party, "
including prosecutors; consent to meet UN 
"or othersOngoing crisis support, assistance with "
"funerals, mourning events, celebrations, "
assistance with family reunification; support 
"to the family as a whole, including family "
members in Sri Lanka
Witnesses provide their testimony to 
investigators or engage in direct advocacy 
with decision makersWitness participation in individual and group 
consultations
Attending group social events
The provision of comprehensive psychosocial support is an essential accompaniment to the 
documentation project and an integral component of witness protection to address both physical 
"and mental damage to individual victims (physical, mental, and to the sense of identity) as well as "
social (betrayal of the sense of social justice and faith in authority). It is worth noting that victims/
"survivors of CRSV often arrive hungry without a change of clothes, winter jackets, or toothbrushes, "
"and even sometimes must borrow shoes to attend the meeting. In these circumstances, it is absurd "
to ask them about their views on accountability without addressing their immediate physical needs.39 
ONE-COUNTRY FOCUS 
Most torture rehabilitation services in the UK integrate victims/survivors 
"from multiple backgrounds in groups. The ITJP’s project, however, "
"specializes in victims/survivors from one country only, which provides "
a beneficial homogeneity for people who have been brutally targeted 
because of their ethnic identity. Putting people who have been isolated 
"by solitary confinement, exiled from loved ones, back together in a group "
where they all speak the same language and come from the same culture 
is enormously reparative. This is why the SAST annual group mourning 
"events have been so powerful for healing. Similarly, such events lead to "
celebrations in repairing a sense of belonging in exile.40 Group events 
"(which involve poetry, art, singing, candle-lighting, and spontaneous "
testimony) are a powerful closed forum for war victims/survivors to bear 
"8witness, overcoming their guilt at surviving. Rituals from Sri Lanka are "
"adapted, such as supermarket roses instead of the Tamil national flower "
and lighting tea lights instead of oil lamps. These ritualized approaches are 
important in organizing the grief reaction.41 “Celebrations and mourning 
events make me feel that we and our loved ones are not forgotten and 
"also take me back to Sri Lanka, feeling I am still with my family in my own "
"country,” a survivor said. "
"“These events are really consoling for us, especially when we are away from our family and country "
"and in difficult situation,” added another. This is particularly true of those who have been subjected "
"to enforced disappearance where, as the same victim/survivor put it, “The disappeared are denied a "
place among the living and also denied a place among the dead.”42
The impact is also powerful because the victims/survivors themselves describe being previously 
"excluded from social gatherings: “As a result of sexual violence, families are separated. When we "
"experience sexual violence, we are marginalized in society, and even if we attend a function or "
"celebration we will be ostracized, others are hesitant to talk to us.”43 "
SURVIVOR STAFF
SAST employs victims/survivors who are themselves recent refugees 
"to run its psychosocial support program, and who are ethnically Tamil. "
Several of them have experienced the same violations as the group they 
serve. Two worked in counselling in the conflict areas and others in other 
"aid programs in the war zone, so victims/survivors trust them in a way "
members of the established diaspora would not be. 
The ITJP has provided the Tamil counselling staff with a UK-based professional trauma and 
"psychosocial expert who provides weekly supervision support for the staff, as they themselves are "
processing a great deal of trauma and have required much more psychological and institutional 
"support in order not to fragment as a professional group. On many occasions, the beneficiaries of "
"the project have tried to split the staff, manipulate and play them off against one another, vent their "
"anger on them, and cross boundaries—and often call them at all times of night and day and play "
"on their sense of guilt or innate vulnerabilities. Additionally, the staff can get caught in the different "
cultural assumptions and legal requirements regarding safeguarding issues in Sri Lanka and in 
"the UK—for example, their responsibilities regarding reporting of domestic abuse, trafficking, and "
"suicide risk. Furthermore, as refugees who lost educational opportunities because of the conflict, "
staff also need additional support with career development. 
The deliberate specialization on one country only enables staff better to navigate the cultural 
nuances victims/survivors from their country employ.44 They understand the complexities of 
"documenting violations, particularly CRSV, within an oppressive political environment such as Sri "
"Lanka, where veiled communication processes exist to protect people. These arise due to the unsafe "
"nature of discussing sensitive topics, especially in this context, because Tamil society often blames "
the victim: “There is an attitude among the general public that rape victims are equally culpable with 
"the perpetrators and contributed to the commission of the crime, suggesting women are equally "
9responsible through their conduct to become a victim of rape.”45
Tamil support staff are able to unpack incredibly sensitive and complex domestic problems in the 
"context of exile, which non-Tamils would likely miss, such as family rejection and all the shame and "
"stigma that CRSV entails. For example, the desire to protect a family’s reputation has meant that young "
male CRSV victims/survivors abroad have taken weeks to disclose abusive treatment from relatives 
"in the UK. In one case, a young man lost 10 kilograms in weight in two months after arriving in the "
"UK because his uncle’s wife didn’t feed him (or heat his room) before he ultimately collapsed, and "
an ambulance had to be called; it was the shame of an ambulance having come to their home that 
"prompted some movement. The wife didn’t want the boy in her house, while the husband, who had lent "
"the family money for the journey to the UK, didn’t want to let him go lest he would have failed to repay "
the money when he eventually obtained asylum. The ITJP’s Tamil staff went to visit the family to gently 
"remind them that although they were in the UK, the wider community was watching. "
SURVIVAL TACTICS
"Additionally, survival strategies are employed by NGOs. It is dangerous for "
NGOs in conflict areas to do more than document violations; going further 
"and identifying the perpetrators (who may well be known) is risky, even more "
"so when identifying senior commanders. In Sri Lanka, NGO staff say they "
will not go into a village to document CRSV or any other serious violation 
because of fear of the security forces and informers. The Sri Lankan NGOs 
would rather build a long-term relationship with survivors through livelihood 
"assistance and, during periods of relative safety, use that as a cover for "
discreet documentation work. Partner organizations in the east of Sri Lanka 
report that it is currently too dangerous to visit villages and ask for consent 
to share existing testimonies with the UN. Even offering basic psychological 
counselling can be dangerous at times because the authorities (who 
are complicit in the violations) regard it as “digging up the past” and not 
"allowing people to “move forward.” Similarly, in exile, the psychosocial "
project run by the ITJP/SAST began by offering English language classes 
"because, apart from the existing need for them, it was an acceptable "
"narrative for survivors to share with their family members, as opposed to "
"their seeking psychosocial support. Education is highly culturally valued, "
and survivors could therefore avoid the social stigma that is felt in the Tamil 
community around accessing mental health care. 
10PATHWAYS TO JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY
"The first step of the ITJP’s legal project involves documentation, with "
independent investigators interviewing the witnesses and taking their 
"testimony, which includes the disclosure of the violations. The second "
step involves the organization collecting contextual and linkage evidence 
to build cases against alleged perpetrators. The evidence is preserved 
"for diverse future accountability initiatives. Individual survivors, with "
"their consent, have met with visiting UN experts and prosecutors (both "
regarding their testimony and for wider transitional justice consultations) 
and have collectively been involved in a dialogue with Global Survivors 
Fund on appropriate reparations for CRSV for a year now.
"The ITJP has used its dossiers on perpetrators for the purposes of litigation, i.e., universal jurisdiction "
"cases, civil claims for damages in Latin America, United States, Singapore, and Europe, as well as "
"several truth recovery initiatives (UN investigations, WGEID, CEDAW, UPR, rapporteurs), engagement "
"with media (see donor reports/website for media stories), report launches, and UN side events and "
online discussion briefings.
"In a hostile environment of state denial of CRSV, the approach taken by an ITJP investigator or SAST "
counsellor can profoundly impact the mental and social well-being of the survivor. The approach 
recognizes that most victims/survivors will probably never have their day in court and their interaction 
with our project may be the only time someone bears witness to the atrocities they survived—and that 
this must be a reparative process in itself.
CENTRALIZING THE VOICES OF VICTIMS 
Placing victims/survivors at the center of accountability strategies helps 
to address the conditions that have led to serious violations in the first 
"place.46 However, victims may not feel safe to discuss CRSV openly. If "
"someone is currently in a location where their safety is compromised, "
"such as Sri Lanka, it may only be appropriate to engage in documentation "
once they reach safety. This would include measures to prevent the risk of 
harm to the families in Sri Lanka of victims living abroad. 
"The SAST/ITJP projects only deal with victims/survivors in exile, which means there are unique "
"dynamics at play in that the victim/survivor is alone, generally without the comfort of family. The "
"victim/survivor also has a lot of time on their hands, as they are not allowed to work due to restrictions "
on their employment while their immigration status is pending. This makes it a good point for 
"disclosure, but also necessitates additional support because of their isolation.47"
There is also a false assumption among donors and Sri Lankan civil society that since these victims/
"survivors are in a wealthy developed country, they will be well looked after. Their geographical location "
in exile sometimes also means that they are not regarded as “real” or “authentic” victims/survivors or 
"victims/survivors with the right to have a say about the future of their country.48 However, when victims/"
11survivors are needed for international accountability processes that do not have access to Sri Lanka (UN 
"PoE, OISL, O/SLAP), the same victims/survivor group is sought out again. "
"Internationally, there tends to be a need for more understanding of the connections that people in exile "
have with those who remain in Sri Lanka. This is a failure to differentiate between people who have 
been in the diaspora for 40 years and those who have just arrived. The discourse is framed in a way that 
misses the constant flow of information back and forth between the exiled population and their relatives 
inside the country. The diaspora into which recent arrivals come is itself constantly retraumatized by the 
"fresh accounts of violations, especially of CRSV.49 Collective victimization can entail an existential threat "
"that promotes a perpetual sense of group vulnerability, collective angst, and a mindset of being “an "
"expiring people, forever on the verge of ceasing to be.”50 Therefore, what is happening politically, socially, "
and economically in their country of origin affects the exiled victim’s ability to recover. When family 
"members are threatened or harmed in Sri Lanka, we see an immediate impact on the victim’s/survivor’s "
mental health abroad. It is for this reason that the project has sometimes provided support in the form of 
"financial assistance to their families in Sri Lanka to resolve the problem because we know that, without "
"this kind of support, the victim/survivor abroad cannot move forward. For example, when an exiled "
"victim’s/survivor’s sibling is arrested in Sri Lanka, the ITJP assists with legal fees or livelihood support for "
"their family, or in other cases, funeral costs."
The involvement of independent non-Tamil international investigators in this work carries much 
"symbolism for the victims/survivors, many of whom feel very deeply that Tamils were abandoned by "
the international community to die on the beaches of Mullaitivu in 2009. The involvement of outsiders 
is significant in that they are perceived symbolically to bear witness on behalf of the international 
"community, albeit belatedly. They are also regarded as being outside Tamil culture when it comes to "
"ensuring safe disclosure, as one male survivor explained: "
The first time I spoke about the sexual violence was when I met with the investigator. It is very 
difficult for me to consider sharing these details of what happened to me with people within 
the Tamil community. If I revealed this type of sexual abuse I would be seen and treated differ -
ently. The investigator is not a Tamil person. I felt able to open up to her as I was assured that 
"if my statement was used for any purpose, it would only be with my consent and my details "
"would be anonymized. Therefore, my identity would not be revealed and I would not suffer the "
shame and stigma from other Tamil people.51
"This of course overlooks the involvement of Tamil interpreters in the process. In one consultation, a "
victim/survivor said that he had been able to disclose CRSV because the older Tamil female interpreter 
had taken him aside before the interview and told him that she had heard all these things before and 
"would not be shocked. She had therefore given him, as a young man, permission to step outside the "
"cultural norms of engagement. Years later, he cited this in a group discussion as the key enabling "
factor for his disclosure. 
Outsiders also bring a meta perspective by seeing the crimes in connection with international 
"law, tracking trends and systematic patterns of the violations. Lawyers and analysts in the ITJP are "
"reconstructing the crime scene, the connection between the violations, and the unit that committed "
the violations. Documentation must follow the highest international standards to provide reliable 
"and probative evidence to authorities, particularly for investigations and accountability mechanisms, "
including possible universal jurisdiction cases. The ITJP has provided both contextual and linkage 
evidence to the UN and prosecutors working on universal jurisdiction cases on units and commanders 
responsible for serious international crimes. 
12EXPERIENCES OF MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS
"It is important to note that victims/survivors have suffered multiple violations, "
"including CRSV, after the war. Investigators do not set out to document "
"CRSV alone, but rather the entirety of the victim/survivor’s experiences, the "
"harm suffered, the context in which it occurred, and the consequences, with "
"the aim of recording what happened to them and, where possible, who was "
responsible. 
REFERRAL PATHWAYS
The victims/survivors are identified and referred to the ITJP through a network of 
"independent lawyers, doctors, and other victims/survivors with whom the ITJP "
has built a relationship of trust over time. Documentation involves an interview 
"with an ITJP lawyer, navigated by a trusted Tamil interpreter, and a written "
statement is recorded in English. Corroborating information is gathered in the 
"form of exhibits, including independent medico-legal reports, complaints by "
"families to the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, and to the police, as well "
"as any habeas corpus applications when made, and finally Tamil media reports. "
DOCUMENTATION IN TERMS OF INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS 
The ITJP ensures that the interviews are conducted according to best 
"international standards, observing the “do no harm” principle and the highest "
levels of confidentiality and security. Great care is taken not to retraumatize 
"victims/survivors during the interview process, to take breaks, and to support "
"them through the process and, where necessary, to have a Tamil-speaking "
counsellor follow up after each day’s interview once the victim/survivor has 
"returned home. Nevertheless, there have been moments in the process "
of gathering evidence when those involved in the documentation process 
have broken down in tears because of the sheer horror and brutality of the 
"accounts being recorded. All ITJP staff, including the investigators, have "
access to support for secondary trauma—and it is our experience that at 
some point everyone needs it. Investigators who are in the field can call the 
program coordinator every night to discuss the case they are documenting 
and to seek psychosocial support as well.
The ITJP’s experience of documentation done well is one of a process that can be liberating for the victim. 
One woman told us that it was as if she had been walking around in London with a blindfold over her eyes 
"until she met us and was able to give a full statement, recounting for the first time years of sexual and "
physical abuse in multiple detention sites.52 She said that giving the statement was like having the blindfold 
"13removed and being able to see again. At the end of several days of a very intense process, victims/"
"survivors have become visibly lightened, saying it was a relief to tell someone their story. There are "
"times when the interviewee has hugged and thanked the investigator at the end of the day, with one "
interviewee having said that the interview and statement-taking was the first time he felt he had been 
treated with respect in the UK.
PRIORITIES
The ITJP’s focus is on comprehensively documenting the diverse accounts 
of different types of victims/survivors and their experiences of the conflict 
"and post-conflict violations, which have given rise to extensive reports. "
"These include recent CRSV,53 torture/CRSV by a particular unit,54 torture/"
"CRSV and disappearance at a specific site,55 as well as other violations, "
such as enforced disappearance. The ITJP has also documented the 
"accounts of many Sinhala security force officers (“insider witnesses”), as "
well as victims/survivors. The ITJP has self-determined its investigative 
"priorities, despite it often not being in sync with donor priorities. Donor "
funding priorities in Sri Lanka tend to be focused on post-wartime 
"violations, and not on documenting ongoing ones."
Sinhala victims/survivors and insider witnesses are not enrolled into the psychosocial program for 
"obvious reasons of security. However, the ITJP interviews and takes statements from them, and SAST "
offers them ongoing psychosocial support on an individual basis. 
The focus on war-related violations has been most successfully employed in the universal jurisdiction 
"cases on Sri Lanka,56 which we launched in addition to instituting claims for damages57 for the crimes "
"of torture, CRSV, and mass enforced disappearances in the closing days of the war. This is due to "
the availability of contextual and linkage evidence that identifies those in command. Such evidence 
includes detailed state accounts of the locations of military units and commanders in the relevant 
"areas on these dates as well as audio visual material, including maps. "
"Still, a damages claim in the US under the Torture Victims Protection Act had to be withdrawn, as the "
"respondent was elected president, thereby benefitting from head of state immunity. It has not been "
"possible to refile the case since, even though the former president ultimately resigned, given that papers "
"would need to be freshly served on him in the US, which is unlikely because his visiting the country "
would expose him to further litigation now that he has left office.58 A Latin American case based on 
universal jurisdiction against a former Sri Lankan ambassador (a former Army commander during the 
war who was in charge of one of the most notorious detention centers in Sri Lanka) resulted in Brazil 
"wanting to transfer the case to the UK while Chile appointed a prosecutor to begin investigations, but "
"the prosecutor was transferred, resulting in a loss of interest in the case by the Chilean authorities as "
the accused had by that time already fled Latin America. This case underlines the need not just for 
timely action when a target is within a jurisdiction but also a conducive political climate and sustained 
"investment by donors in international, multi-lingual advocacy to support such legal initiatives once they "
are successfully launched.
14PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT
An ITJP witness statement is a comprehensive account of the totality 
"of violations, including CRSV, taken at a specific point in time—though "
it has been our practice to come back to certain witnesses later in our 
"engagement with them for supplementary statements. By contrast, the "
engagement in the psychosocial project remains ongoing (see diagram).
"Apart from the support for victims/survivors, this ongoing weekly contact with witnesses has a "
number of additional advantages for the documentation/legal accountability work: 
• Victims/survivors refer newcomers to the project.
• Victims/survivors recall more events over time and disclose more information.
• Victims/survivors tell us what is going on in the villages of the conflict areas where 
their family members live and to whom they talk on a daily basis so we have up-to-date 
information on the repression. 
• Trust in the organization has been built over many years so that we can go back to 
"members of the group and ask them to testify, share information with third parties "
"including the UN, or fill knowledge gaps. For example, when the UN Sri Lanka "
"Accountability Mechanism (OSLAP) wanted to consult victims about transitional justice, "
the ITJP was able to organize at short notice 60 people to meet them in small groups 
"over two days because we had the network and structures in place, and some victims/"
survivors told the UN they only came because they trusted our organization.

"15Lessons, Reflections and Recommendations "
The “Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and 
Reparations for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights 
Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law (Basic 
"Principles)” explicitly recognize five forms of reparation: restitution, "
"compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction, and guarantees of non-repetition.59 "
This is an inalienable right that all victims/survivors of serious abuse and their 
"dependents are entitled to, as “[r]ehabilitation seeks to achieve maximum "
"physical and psychological fitness by addressing the individual, the family, "
local community and even the society as a whole.”60
The fundamental principle underlying reparations is that a victim/survivor needs to re-establish a belief 
in a just society and engage in a process that reaffirms their basic humanity and dignity. Obtaining 
social justice for the victim/survivor carries with it a huge potential for healing and is crucial to the 
process of mediation between their past experiences and life in exile. It endeavors to ensure that their 
human rights are not again ignored or forgotten. This is especially so because the people in the group 
we support are the ones who were targeted in Sri Lanka for their activism in demanding their human 
rights. Though abroad they are keen to speak for those inside the country: “I have the opportunity 
"to give my voice for other survivors who experienced torture, sexual violence and other forms of ill "
"treatment.” They also observe that where an innovation works, such as the CRSV dialogue initiated, it "
could be beneficial for others in the same predicament: “The sessions like these will be useful to other 
survivors both in the country and outside of Sri Lanka.”61 
"However, the sense of isolated helplessness experienced under torture is often mirrored in the alienation "
"a person experiences in exile. For many victims/survivors, the concept of community has itself been "
"violated and feelings of betrayal and mistrust predominate, just as the perpetrators intended. The SAST "
"project is a therapeutic community that endeavors to create a safe place for victims, while the ITJP "
"project works on truth, justice, and accountability for the violations they have endured. "
SAST rebuilding communal life. Rebuilding communal life usually takes place at the village level. 
The safe space of a church is used by the ITJP as a venue that has many sub-spaces where different 
"activities all happen in sight of one another, including counselling carried out in a private side room. A "
volunteer is in charge of organizing birthday celebrations after lunch and celebrations of those who 
"are granted asylum. Additionally, Diwali, Thai Pongal, Tamil New Year, and Christmas are celebrated. "
Mourning events are organized by the victims/survivors for May 18 and November 27—key events 
"in the Tamil calendar. When a member of the group is bereaved, SAST pays travel costs for their "
friends to visit their home to offer condolences. Excursions are held in the summer to see London 
"sights, travel to Brighton for the sea, go bowling, or play cricket in the park. These events are critical "
in bonding the group and “creating happy memories.” They repair the social connections severed by 
"torture and CRSV, solitary confinement, life in exile, separation from loved ones, not telephoning home "
"for fear of endangering loved ones, stigma, poverty, and inability to speak the host country language.  "
 
"This is social healing.62 As a survivor said, “These sessions help me to heal myself from the impact of the "
"experience.” Social attachments play a critical role in how humans manage adversity, and social projects "
such as SAST serve a critical function in how people respond to trauma. A survivor who was involved in 
"the Global Survivors Fund CRSV reparation consultation commented, “The experience of sexual violence "
"is unforgettable and unforgivable, sharing with people close to me may help me to reduce the pain and "
"16trauma… Initially, I was feeling scared, shy, even ashamed to attend these sessions; I feel confident "
enough to talk to others about it [CRSV]. I kindly ask these sessions to continue.”
Justice & Medical Repair Intertwined. Post-conflict trauma and healing should be understood as a 
process and not just the psychological result of an event. Healing occurs sequentially within the wider 
"social and political context of a conflict cycle, of which truth, justice, and reparation are all vital parts.63 "
 
The ITJP’s approach takes account of individual and collective trauma understood within the 
specific historical and sociopolitical context. Victims/survivors therefore seek not only medical and 
"psychological help but also security, acknowledgement, social and legal justice, and recognition "
of what their violations represent. Implicit in their request for help is a fundamental need for 
"reparations, both moral and material. Reparations are, at the same time, an important message of "
"acknowledgement, inclusion, and dignity, which affirms that survivors are valued both individually "
"and as members of the community. SAST and the ITJP, though independent projects, link truth "
"recovery, justice, and reparations as a means of addressing both the human rights and health "
"needs of victims, essentially integrating recognition and social justice. The projects translate the "
"various international instruments addressing accountability for human rights violations, integrating "
"survivors’ need for security, accountability, and social justice with their right to legal assistance and "
trauma counselling. Whenever an advance occurs on the justice and accountability front in which 
"the ITJP played a role, victims are briefed, discuss it, and take enormous pride in the achievement. "
Counselling Supervision. Clinical or counselling supervision is distinct from managerial supervision 
and is the training tool for the development of effective therapy skills. It supports the professional 
"growth of the counsellors by providing a space for reflection, self-assessment, and skills development. "
"The supervision sessions help staff expand their theoretical knowledge, improve their clinical "
"skills, and gain new perspectives on their casework. While the individual victims’/survivors’ details "
"are confidential, counsellors are encouraged to examine the interaction between them and the "
"CRSV victim, with the supervisor identifying trauma and therapeutic principles that can be applied. "
Counsellors are encouraged to discuss their personal problems and whether they obscure their 
"professional judgment in dealing with victims/survivors. However, working through these problems "
belongs to separate individual therapy sessions that are also provided.  
 
"As the SAST staff are themselves survivors, they bring their own pre-conceptions and perspectives "
"about trauma, culture, gender, and justice, as well as ideas about what their own roles should be. "
Supervision assists them in finding a common framework and language and a joint approach to the 
work. The ITJP has developed a system that allows any staff member to take charge of any situation 
"and to be confident that they could call on another staff member, as well as the supervisor, for the "
necessary information and support. 
CHALLENGES
Lack of Justice. There is growing frustration and feeling of deep betrayal among victims/survivors 
about the lack of accountability for the gross violations committed during the war and post-
"conflict period, as well as the failure to implement transitional justice in Sri Lanka and abroad. "
Victims/survivors have acutely felt the difference in the response of the international community 
"to the conflict in Ukraine compared with Sri Lanka, particularly around the various investigative "
and accountability measures established. When visited by various UN delegations and special 
"17rapporteurs, the victim/survivor group expressed feelings of abandonment, both from the 2009 "
"war and also since then, due to a lack of accountability at both the domestic and international "
levels. Added to this is a frustration at the lip service paid to human rights and Tamil rights by 
international politicians who then do not deliver any real pressure on the government of Sri 
Lanka. Local politicians in Sri Lanka have also been unsuccessful in pressuring the government 
to deal with accountability.  
 
The ITJP plays a critical role in mediating contact between victims/survivors and other international 
"NGOs, member states, the UN, and human rights activists from different communities and "
organizations inside the country. The wider failure to achieve justice has the risk of rebounding on 
"the ITJP; in a recent dialogue a survivor said, “I have a question as to where we can go and who "
has the power to help the Tamils. Will ITJP help us to get the solution for the Tamils? When Tamils 
"ruled ourselves, we were living happily with no problems. We want to have a situation like that. Will "
ITJP make sure we get o solution which is acceptable for Tamils?”64
Insecure Funding Future. Assisting people whose lives have been destroyed requires that they 
"feel safe—and for this, the organization supporting them also needs to be secure in its funding "
"levels. The ITJP struggles with short uncertain funding cycles, which are mainly project based "
and do not cover core expenses. Having just been funded to develop the capacity of our staff 
and having just opened up a transformative discussion with a group of 50+ male and female 
"survivors on CRSV, ironically, we now risk closing down our whole SAST program altogether "
within 12 months due to insufficient funding. 
Donor Reporting. Monitoring and evaluation need rethinking for projects that assist traumatized 
"victims/survivors. Grants require us to survey clients on a quarterly basis on their feedback, "
which can be too intrusive for victims/survivors. New ideas on reporting that actually captures 
the psychological achievements (rather than typical development project goals of numerical 
metrics)—including more donor site visits—need developing. 
"Gender. Because of a lack of resources for many years, the SAST project could not run separate "
"groups for men and women. When COVID-19 set in, we segregated the groups online by gender, "
"as otherwise families would not allow young women to participate. Throughout COVID-19, we "
"ran separate groups for counselling women, which morphed into a sewing group and then a "
"poetry writing group. The female group was small and, although different in terms of ages and "
"diversity of experiences in Sri Lanka, they became very tightly bonded and supportive of one "
"another. When we returned to physical meetings post COVID-19, the women initially would "
"not agree to mix in with men again, which meant a change in counsellor. However, the recent "
consultations on CRSV have seen a mixed gender group of 50 people participate because 
"there were not enough resources to segregate them. At first, the women were very muted, but "
"as time has passed, their participation in the dialogue has enabled them to occupy space and "
express their own views. The feedback from men and women from these sessions has been 
very positive: “I was confused as to how I am going to come out from the trauma caused by the 
sexual violence but these sessions have given some hope.”
18RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Perform Outreach to Address the Justice Deficit and Manage  
 Victim/Survivor Community Expectations
"When the voices of victims/survivors are silenced, their pain and suffering disregarded, their "
"quest for truth and justice denied, it creates a sense of injustice and a deep sense of mistrust "
in the system. This breeds feelings of marginalization and exclusion and an acute desire for 
"retribution. By acknowledging and validating the experiences of victims/survivors, providing "
"opportunities for their voices to be heard, and promoting a comprehensive understanding of "
"history, societies can work toward breaking the cycle of trauma and building a foundation of "
"truth, justice, and healing that mitigates the risk of radicalization.  "
 
Victims’/survivors’ feeling of rage and betrayal over the absence of justice and accountability 
in Sri Lanka is increasing exponentially as time goes by. There is a huge gulf between victims’/
survivors’ aspirations for justice and actual reality. The sense of anger over the gap poses a 
risk to any future transitional justice initiatives. We see this increasing frustration not only in the 
"victims/survivors in the project and in Sri Lanka but also in the wider Diaspora. To have impact, "
victims/survivors—irrespective of their geographical location—need to be able to work together 
"for achievable goals, rather than fragment in division, and ground those goals in what is possible "
in the current political climate.  
 
"We propose a series of bilingual, expert-led outreach sessions initially with ITJP staff and victims/"
survivors in the SAST project and then more widely with the Sri Lankan Tamil community and 
the community organizations providing trauma and counselling services as well as legal aid to 
discuss opportunities that currently exist for progress on accountability and justice; and also a 
parallel series of meetings between families of the disappeared in Sri Lanka and other victim/
survivor groups with Colombo-based diplomats so they understand firsthand the situation on 
the ground. 
2. Include the “Wicked Fairy Godmother” groups
"In the fairy tale “Sleeping Beauty,” the wicked fairy godmother is not invited to the princess’s "
"christening and so puts a curse on her that comes into effect 15 years later. Similarly, excluding "
"groups that are perceived as more difficult has a price down the line. Donors, including "
"member states supporting and funding transitional justice mechanisms for Sri Lanka, need to "
"have a more holistic, historically informed, multi-disciplinary, and consultative approach that "
incorporates not just the views of compliant political groupings who are thought to be easy to 
"work with but also more radical groups and victims/survivors who feel angry, betrayed, and "
"excluded. Victims’ groups don’t want truth recovery on its own, and are forceful in saying that it "
cannot substitute for criminal accountability reparations and the guarantee of non-recurrence.  
 
Victims/survivors also complain that they are sought for meetings with donors only in advance 
"of, for example, a Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative summit and only as generic "
examples of a victim/survivor without reference to the political specificities of the country 
they come from and its track record on CRSV prevention—and without regard to the donor’s 
"engagement with deniers, including government and the security forces, in Sri Lanka. They are "
19also extremely angry that the UN (OHCHR) needs and wants their testimony for accountability 
for past violations but refuses to acknowledge or engage with current CRSV violations that 
continue in Sri Lanka. This sort of selective approach is damaging for the victims/survivors.  
 
"We propose a series of ongoing, in-person, confidential meetings between donors, UN "
"agencies and special mandate holders, Geneva core group member states with (a) victims/"
"survivors (including recent ones) and, separately, (b) excluded diaspora groups abroad. Group "
meetings should be held so that victims/survivors do not have to keep on being retraumatized 
by revisiting these issues with multiple stakeholders. Psychosocial support is to be provided for 
participants and a feedback loop ensured for victims/survivors to know what the impact of their 
advocacy is.
3. Commit to Integrating Documentation and Psychosocial Support
"There needs to be more advocacy with donors who support CRSV documentation, and we must "
"ensure that, as a norm, they include substantive psychosocial support into the initial design of "
"all projects. The ITJP’s sister psychosocial support program, SAST, has been critical for witness "
"protection and at times has literally saved lives. “Without the counsellor, I wouldn’t be here "
"today,” said one suicidal victim, although the ITJP has struggled to convince donors of the link. "
"Without the ability to offer this psychosocial support, the documentation process could be "
perceived as extractive and exploitative.  
 
We propose a roundtable meeting of donors who fund work on CRSV documentation and 
a subgroup who fund work on Sri Lanka and CRSV to discuss a donor pledge to include a 
"percentage of grant funding for documentation to be allocated for victim/survivor support, "
"which would include trauma and counselling support, legal assistance, and basic necessities."
4. Integrate the Work of Psychosocial Practitioners Overseas  
 and the People Inside the Country in a Holistic Fashion as  
 Part of Any Reconciliation Process 
The ITJP support group is supporting victims/survivors abroad to become professional 
"counsellors who understand the pain and suffering of victims/survivors in the country of origin, "
and also have space and time to develop their thinking outside the country. The SAST program 
in London is an incubator for ideas where profound experiences can be processed by victims/
"survivors in a secure environment, although this learning is not being shared with practitioners "
"in Sri Lanka. Likewise, the survivor staff abroad have left their country and can learn from the "
developments and impediments inside Sri Lanka in delivering mental health care.  
 
We propose more investment to leverage the learning from the project and forge connections 
between Sri Lankans abroad and organizations working on the same issues inside the country 
through in-person training and exchanging practices in online supervision sessions. 
205. Conduct Intergenerational Trauma Research
"Sri Lankans affected by the conflict include individuals who were born before, during, or after "
"the war. Transgenerational transmission of trauma encompasses more than mere transmission, "
as it involves the impact on subsequent generations through exposure to unspoken memories 
and experiences stored in the unconscious mind. These experiences become entrenched 
"within the family unit. Each successive generation is affected, leading to a new emerging "
generation that Tamil case workers inside and outside the country describe as displaying 
"increased aggression or turning inward, as well as forming potentially violent and dangerous "
group tendencies. Intergenerational trauma must also take account historical events such as 
"in Mullivaikkal at the end of the war in 2009, the enforced disappearances and killings of loved "
"ones,  the rehabilitation camps, torture, and sexual violence—all of which have caused collective "
"trauma that may have a lasting impact on generations to come, and an enduring impact on "
"generations of people in Sri Lanka and the diaspora. Abroad, we see this among the children of "
LTTE cadres who disappeared at the war’s end. This is an area that needs more research. The 
"unresolved trauma and its associated emotions fuel feelings of injustice, anger, betrayal, and "
"resentment. In the absence of a truthful and comprehensive account of history, justice, and "
"reparations, the younger generation seeking answers and meaning to their lives may become "
vulnerable to radical ideologies that offer simplistic explanations or narratives that validate their 
experiences of pain and victimhood.  
 
"We propose the commission of a research paper on “collective traumata,” which is a "
"traumatization experienced by a larger population for a lengthy period of time, as an extreme "
"long-lasting burden, as in the case of Tamils over three decades. In the period since the end "
"of the way in 2009, they suffered from terror over months or even years, from physical cruelty, "
"hunger, powerlessness, humiliation, and dehumanization. Such a research paper needs to "
"explore the “survivor syndrome,” which is characterized by endless grief, and “survivor’s guilt” "
accompanied by an inability to speak about the pain experienced. The paper should examine 
this over and above mutual psychosomatic reactions and illnesses and chronic reactive 
aggression turned inward against self and leading to a chronic reactive depression.

"Conflict-Related Sexual Violencein Ukraine: An Opportunity forGender-Sensitive Policymaking?Meaningful change is needed in Ukraine’s response to the conflict-related sexual violence,which aﬀects both women and men.EXPERT COMMENTPUBLISHED 18 AUGUST 2020UPDATED 27 AUGUST 2021 — 3 MINUTE READ20/06/2024, 00:55Page 1 of 6"
"The virus of violenceAccording to the UN () and the International Criminal Court (ICC, ), conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) is quite  in hostilities-affected eastern Ukraine. Both sexes are subjected to sexualized torture, rape, forcednudity, prolonged detention in unsanitary conditions with members of the other sexand threats of sexual violence towards detainees or their relatives to forceconfessions. Men are . Women additionally suffer from sexual slavery,enforced and survival prostitution, and other forms of sexual abuse. Women are: in the hostilities-affected area, every third woman hasexperienced or witnessed CRSV as opposed to every fourth man.COVID-19 has redirected funding priorities,  of medicaland psychological help for CRSV survivors worldwide. In Ukraine, the veryreporting of such violence, stigmatized even before the pandemic, has been furtherundermined by the country-wide quarantine-induced restrictions on movement andthe closure of checkpoints between the government-controlled and temporarilyuncontrolled areas.Addressing CRSV in UkraineThe stigma of CRSV, the patchy domestic legislation, and the unpreparedness of thecriminal justice system to deal with such cases prevent the authorities from properlyhelping those harmed in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine armed conflict.CRSV is equally traumatizing yet different in nuance for men and women. Femalevictims often choose not to report the violence. Women avoid protractedproceedings likely to cause re-traumatization and the disclosure of their experience,which could be particularly excruciating in small communities where everybodyknows everyone.Men also struggle to provide their accounts of CRSV. Their suppressed pain andshame of genital mutilation and other CRSV result in sexual and other healthpara. 7para. 279prevalentcastratedmore exposed to CRSVaffecting the availability20/06/2024, 00:55Page 2 of 6"
"disfunctions. Combined with the post-conflict mental health struggles, this has beenshown to lead to increased .The very investigation of CRSV in Ukraine is challenging. Certain tests andexaminations need to be done straight after an assault, which in the context ofdetention and grey zones of hostilities is often impossible. Specialized medical andpsychological support is lacking. Investigators and prosecutors are hardly trained todeal with CRSV to the point that they  about it during theinterviews. Burdened by trauma and stigma, survivors are inclined to report tortureor inhuman treatment, but not the sexualized aspects thereof.Seven years into the conflict, the state still has not criminalized the full spectrum ofCRSV in its domestic law. Ukraine’s Criminal Code contains a brief list of theviolations of the rules and customs of warfare in article 438. It prohibits theinhuman treatment of civilians and POWs but does not list any types of CRSV.The article has an open-ended reference to Ukraine’s ratified international treaties,from which the responsibility for other armed conflict violations may be derived. Forthe more detailed norms on CRSV, Ukraine should refer at least to GenevaConvention IV protecting civilians and two additional protocols to the GenevaConventions, to which it is a party.However, the novelty of the war context for Ukrainian investigators, prosecutors andjudges and their overcautiousness about the direct application of internationalconventions mean that in practice, observing the treaty or jurisprudentialinstruction on CRSV has been slow.Use of the Criminal Code’s articles on sexual violence not related to an armedconflict is not viable. Such provisions fail to reflect the horrible variety andcomplexity of CRSV committed in hostilities. They also envisage lesser punishmentthan a war crime of sexual violence would entail. Cumulatively, this fails to accountfor the intention of a perpetrator, the gravity of the crime and the trauma of itsvictims.domestic violence and even suicidedo not ask questions20/06/2024, 00:55Page 3 of 6"
"The lack of public debate and state action on CRSV understates its magnitude.Ukraine should break its silence about CRSV in Donbas and make addressing thisviolence part of its actionable agenda - in law and in implementation.Ukraine should incorporate all war crimes and crimes against humanity of CRSV inits domestic legislation; ensure a more gendered psychological and medical supportfor both sexes; establish rehabilitation and compensation programmes for CRSVsurvivors; create special victims and witness protection schemes; consider thedifferent stigmatizing effects of CRSV on men and women in criminal proceedingsand engage the professionals of the same sex as the victim; map CRSV in the biggerpicture of other crimes in Donbas to better understand the motives of theperpetrators; submit more information about CRSV to the ICC and educate thepublic to destigmatize the CRSV survivors.The drafters of Ukraine’s transitional justice roadmap should ensure that ithighlights CRSV, adopts a gendered approach to it and endorses femaleparticipation as a crucial component of reconciliation and broader policymaking.Embracive policymakingAlthough ‘the discriminatory line almost inevitably hurts women,’ ‘every genderdiscrimination is a two-edged sword’, Ruth Bader Ginsburg famously  beforethe US Supreme Court. This could not be more relevant for Ukraine. The conflict -and lockdown-related violence has reverberated deeper within Ukrainian society,raising fundamental questions about the roles of both sexes and gender equality.The failure to address CRSV and its different stigmas for both sexes mirrors thegeneral lack of sustainable gender lenses in Ukraine’s policymaking.

  Conflict -related sexual violence  
 
 
  Report of the Secretary -General  
 
 
 I. Introduction  
 
 
"1. The present report, which covers the period from January to December 2022, is "
"submitted pursuant to Security Council resolution 2467 (2019) , in which the Council "
"reques ted me to report annually on the implementation of resolutions 1820 (2008) , "
"1888 (2009) , 1960 (2010) , 2106 (2013)  and 2467 (2019) , and to recommend strategic "
actions.  
"2. In 2022, militarization and the proliferation of illicit arms escalated in the wake "
"of a series of unconstitutional changes of government, exposing civili ans to "
"heightened levels of sexual violence, amid shrinking civic space and weakened rule "
of law in settings affected by conflict. State and non -State armed groups continued to 
"target civilians with rape, gang rape and abductions. United Nations -designated  "
"terrorist groups, other non -State armed groups and transnational criminal networks "
"used sexual violence as a tactic, destabilizing already fragile contexts. In some "
"settings, national authorities  were shored up by an array of actors, including militia "
"or private military and security companies and groups, fighting alongside national "
"armed forces. This has complicated attribution for serious crimes, including sexual "
"violence, which has in turn compounded challenges with regard to accountability. In "
"a number  of countries, civilian demonstrations and protests were met with "
"disproportionate use of force, including the use of rape as an instrument of repression "
and political intimidation. Activists and advocates working to defend the rights of 
"survivors were sub jected to reprisals, including sexual violence and harassment. The "
targeting of public health facilities in some settings impeded access to services by 
survivors in a context of increasing needs. Amid worsening humanitarian crises and 
"economic shocks, sexu al violence hindered women’s livelihood activities and girls’ "
"access to education, while generating profits for armed and violent extremist groups "
through conflict -driven trafficking in persons.  
"3. Across several settings, patterns of sexual violence persi sted and deepened, "
"including in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti and South Sudan. "
"In Ukraine, the human rights monitoring mission and the Independent International "
Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine have documented and reported sexual vi olence as 
a form of torture and inhumane treatment against civilians and prisoners of war 
"(A/77/533 ). In May 2022, my Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict "
signed a framework of cooperation on behalf of the United Nations system with the 
Government of Ukraine to prevent and respond to conflict -related sexual violence.  
S/2023/413   
 
23-08418  2/35 
" 4. In most contexts, impunity remained the norm, while emerging threats in the "
"largely ungoverned digital space, as well as the combination of climate insecurity, "
"State fragility and structural gender inequality, further exposed women and girls to "
conflict -related sexual violence. Weakened or collapsed rule of law institutions have 
creat ed a risk of the “rule of lawlessness” by eroding what should be the first line of 
"defence against atrocity crimes. Moreover, the emboldening effects of impunity for "
patterns of conflict -related sexual violence demonstrate the importance of harnessing 
"the preventive power of the rule of law, which is a central tenet of Our Common "
Agenda ( A/75/982 ). There is no better guarantee of prevention than for States to 
"uphold their human  rights responsibilities, as outlined in my call to action for human "
"rights. For vulnerable populations, this means building individual and institutional "
"resilience against economic, security and climate shocks, including by fostering an "
"enabling environme nt for the meaningful participation of women, and of communities "
"at risk, in political and peacebuilding processes. States should ensure access to "
"multisectoral services, justice and reparations for survivors of conflict -related sexual "
violence.  
"5. The ter m “conflict -related sexual violence”, as used in the present report, refers "
"to rape, sexual slavery, forced prostitution, forced pregnancy, forced abortion, "
"enforced sterilization, forced marriage, and any other form of sexual violence of "
"comparable gravit y perpetrated against women, men, girls or boys that is directly or "
"indirectly linked to a conflict. This link may be evident in the profile of the perpetrator, "
"who is often affiliated with a State or non -State armed group, including those "
"designated as te rrorist groups by the United Nations; the profile of the victim, who is "
"frequently an actual or perceived member of a persecuted political, ethnic or religious "
"minority, or targeted on the basis of actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender "
"identity;  a climate of impunity, which is generally associated with State collapse; "
"cross -border consequences, such as displacement or trafficking; and/or violations of "
the provisions of a ceasefire agreement. The term also encompasses trafficking in 
"persons for th e purpose of sexual violence and/or exploitation, when committed in "
situations of conflict.  
"6. While many communities are affected by the threat, occurrence or legacy of "
"conflict -related sexual violence, the present report is focused on countries for whic h "
information verified by the United Nations exists. It should be read in conjunction 
"with the 13 previous reports, which provide a cumulative basis for the listing of 49 "
"parties (see annex). The majority of listed parties are non -State actors, with severa l "
having been designated as terrorist groups according to the sanctions list of the 
"Security Council Committee pursuant to resolutions 1267 (1999) , 1989 (2011) , and "
"2253 (2015)  concerning Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Da’esh), Al -Qaida a nd "
"associated individuals, groups, undertakings and entities. National military and police "
"forces that are listed are required to adopt specific, time -bound commitments and "
action plans to address violations and are prohibited from participating in United 
"Nations peace operations. Effective implementation of commitments, including the "
"cessation of violations, is a key consideration for the delisting of parties. Parties to "
"conflict, including non -State armed groups, are also required to implement action "
plans to prevent and address sexual violence in accordance with their obligations 
under international humanitarian law and relevant Security Council resolutions.  
"7. The deployment of women’s protection advisers, who are responsible for "
"convening the monitoring, analysis and reporting arrangements on conflict -related "
"sexual violence in the field, has ensured more timely, accurate and reliable "
information and helped to overcome the dearth of data that is often used as a pretext 
for inaction. Deepening the evidence base requires sustained political resolve and 
"resources. To date, the Security Council has explicitly called for the deployment of "
women’s protection advisers in the mandate authorizations and renewals of 10 peace 
 S/2023 /413 
 
3/35 23-08418  
 operations. A total of four peacekeeping missions and four special political missions 
have established dedicated monitoring arrangements and incorporated the early 
warning indicators of conflict -relate d sexual violence into their protection 
frameworks. While the timely deployment of women’s protection advisers is a widely 
"endorsed priority, the level of human and budgetary resources is far from "
"commensurate with the scale of the challenge. To date, wome n’s protection advisers "
have been deployed to just 8 of the more than 20 countries covered in the present 
"report.  In November, the Informal Expert Group on Women and Peace and Security "
convened its annual meeting with my Special Representative on Sexual Vi olence in 
Conflict and senior women’s protection advisers to discuss strategies for advancing 
"the implementation of the mandate (see S/2022/1005 ). At that meeting, my Specia l "
"Representative recommended, inter alia, that these positions be integrated into the "
"regular budgets of United Nations peace operations, particularly during transitional "
"processes, and called for earmarked contributions for the deployment of women’s "
"prote ction advisers to all situations of concern, including to regional hubs in response "
"to cross -border dynamics, and to the offices of United Nations resident and "
"humanitarian coordinators, in line with Security Council resolution 2467 (2019) . "
"8. In 2022, the inter -agency network, United Nations Action against Sexual "
"Violence in Conflict, continued to unite efforts across more than 20 United Nations "
system entities to preve nt and respond to conflict -related sexual violence. The 
network serves as the primary coordination forum through which my Special 
"Representative promotes efforts to deliver as one. The network also provides strategic, "
country -level support through the conf lict-related sexual violence multi -partner trust 
fund. Programming through this pooled fund advances the survivor -centred approach 
"set out in Security Council resolution 2467 (2019) . Between 2009 and 2022, 54 "
"projects were supported in 17 conflict -affected countries, as well as a range of "
"regional and global initiatives. In 2022, United Nations Action funded an innovative "
"project in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, implemented through local "
"women’s cooperatives in 13 conflict -free mining sites. Through that project, hundreds "
of survivors of conflict -related sexual violence who are involved in the artisanal 
"mining sector have been able to access medical, psychosocial,  legal and "
socioeconomic reintegration support. In order to enhance structural and operational 
"prevention, the network launched a “Framework for the prevention of conflict -related "
"sexual violence” in September, which articulates a two -track approach that i s aimed "
"at both preventing sexual violence in the first instance, by tackling its systemic root "
"causes, and mitigating the secondary harms to affected individuals and communities, "
"such as stigmatization and reprisals, which arise in its wake. In addition, the network "
released a white paper scoping opportunities for private sector engagement in support 
of efforts to tackle this scourge.  
"9. In 2022, the Team of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict, "
"in accordance with its mandate under S ecurity Council resolution 1888 (2009) , "
continued to assist national authorities in over a dozen countries in strengthening rule 
of law institutions to enhance account ability for conflict -related sexual violence. In 
"Guinea, the ad hoc tribunal  to prosecute the former President, Moussa Dadis Camara, "
and 10 other men accused of responsibility for the incidents of massacre and mass 
"rape in Guinea on 28 September 2009 was i naugurated in September 2022, and the "
opening was attended by my Special Representative. The Team had supported the 
accountability process for over a decade by providing sustained technical assistance 
"to the Guinean authorities, including support to a nati onal panel of judges during the "
"investigative phase from 2012 to 2017, and, at the request of the Ministry of Justice "
"in 2022, advising on legislation related to reparations and the protection of victims "
"and witnesses. In Ukraine, the Team supported the im plementation of the framework "
"of cooperation, including on strengthening rule of law and accountability for sexual "
violence crimes through support to the justice sector and the design of reparations 
S/2023/413   
 
23-08418  4/35 
" programmes for victims, as well as  putting in place risk mitigation measures against "
conflict -related trafficking in persons for the purposes of sexual exploitation and/or 
prostitution; conducted a comprehensive legal review of Ukrainian criminal law 
provisions concerning conflict -related sexual violence; and co ntributed to the 
development of a strategy for a survivor - and witness -centred approach to case 
"management, led by the Office of the Prosecutor General. In the Central African "
"Republic, the Team collaborated with other United Nations entities to assist nat ional "
"police and prosecutorial authorities in drafting an investigation plan, which led to the "
collection of more than 120 witness statements related to sexual violence. In the 
"Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Team provided technical support on "
"repara tions for victims of international crimes, pursuant to the Government’s plans to "
"establish a national fund for reparations for victims of sexual violence. In the Sudan, "
the Team conducted a collaborative technical assessment of the criminal justice 
"respons e to conflict -related sexual violence, based on which it co -organized six "
"tailored training sessions for the authorities. In addition, it supported the "
"re-establishment of the North Darfur Criminal Justice Forum, which plays a key role "
in coordinating the response to such crimes in the region. The Team continued to roll 
out the Model Legislative Provisions and Guidance on the Investigation and 
Prosecution of Conflict -Related Sexual Violence and to disseminate lessons learned 
"with respect to counter -terroris m, anti -trafficking and policing efforts, as well as "
regarding reparative justice.  
10. While acknowledging that conflict -related sexual violence committed by parties 
to conflict is distinct from incidents of sexual exploitation and abuse that continue to 
"be committed by United Nations staff, related personnel in and implementing partners "
"complex operating environments, I reiterate my commitment to improving the way in "
which the Organization prevents and addresses such conduct. In my report on special 
"measu res for protection from sexual exploitation and abuse ( A/77/748 ), I provided "
information on efforts to strengthen the system -wide response and ensure full 
implementation of the zero -tolerance policy.  
 
 
 II. Sexual violence including as a tactic of war and terrorism: 
"patterns, trends and emerging concerns  "
 
 
"11. Sexual violence continued to be used as a tactic of war, torture and terrorism "
"amid deepening political and security crises, compounded by militarization and the "
illicit proliferation of arms. Civilians have been disproportionat ely affected in the 
"wake of a series of unconstitutional changes of government since 2021, notably in "
"Afghanistan, Mali, Myanmar and the Sudan, which reversed fragile progress on "
women’s rights. Non -State armed groups continued to use conflict -related sexu al 
violence to consolidate control over territories and over lucrative natural resources. 
"In several settings, conflict -related sexual violence was perpetrated as a form of "
retaliation against individuals and communities for their perceived or actual 
affiliation with rival armed groups. While national political and peace processes 
"continued to advance in  some contexts, at the subnational level, intercommunal "
"violence persisted, including incidents of abduction and sexual slavery. Globally, the "
"trend of incr easing recourse to mercenaries, mercenary -related actors and private "
military and security companies by parties to conflict has been accompanied by an 
increase in the number of violations of international humanitarian law and human 
"rights ( A/HRC/51/25 ). In Mali, Myanmar, South Sudan, Ukraine and elsewhere, "
private contractors or militias and self -defence groups were used to reinforce military 
operations. Four Special Rapport eurs of the Human Rights Council and two Working 
Groups of the Human Rights Council publicly called for an immediate independent 
investigation into “gross human rights abuses and possible war crimes and crimes 
 S/2023 /413 
 
5/35 23-08418  
 against humanity” committed in Mali by Governm ent forces and a “private military 
contractor” since 2021.The ever more complex array of actors has complicated 
attribution of responsibility for crimes of sexual violence and undermined 
"accountability for those crimes, while humanitarian access constraint s continued to "
hinder the monitoring and documentation of this already underreported crime. In 
"almost all settings covered in the present report, long -standing barriers to reporting "
"and in accessing services, including stigma and fear of retaliation, were amplified by "
"political instability, economic hardship, institutional collapse and prevailing "
"insecurity. Attacks on health centres occurred in Ethiopia, Haiti, Mali, Ukraine and "
"elsewhere, limiting access to life -saving services, including sexual and repro ductive "
"care. In some contexts, the operating space for service providers virtually vanished, "
"as in Afghanistan, where women have been progressively erased from public life. "
"Despite the myriad of entrenched and emerging challenges, survivors and service "
providers continued to report sexual violence crimes. The present report is limited to 
incidents of conflict -related sexual violence that were verified by the United Nations. 
"While it serves to convey the severity and brutality of recorded cases, it does not  "
purport to convey the full scale and prevalence of these crimes globally.  
"12. In some settings, disturbing trends of gender -based hate speech and incitement "
to violence fuelled conflict in which rape and other forms of sexual violence were 
used to humili ate and destabilize targeted communities. In the Democratic Republic 
"of the Congo, inflammatory rhetoric targeting the United Nations Organization "
Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) resulted 
"in insecurity and narrowed t he operating space for United Nations entities to monitor, "
"report, and respond to, cases of sexual violence. In settings such as Ethiopia and "
"Myanmar, Internet restrictions impeded the ability of survivors to gain access to "
"information, with frequent telec ommunications shutdowns hindering access to "
"helplines and other support services. In Myanmar, South Sudan, the Sudan and "
"elsewhere, advocates and activists who intervened to assist survivors were harassed "
"and threatened, with such attacks occurring online,  in some settings. At the same time, "
"women and girls, who constitute the majority of victims, are disproportionately "
"affected by the lack of access to digital tools and resources, thereby hindering their "
access to life -saving security and public health inf ormation and networks. Those 
circumstances illustrate that the gender -based digital divide is nowhere more acute 
and perilous than in situations of conflict.  
"13. In 2022, patterns of sexual violence continued to be used as part of the repertoire "
"of politi cal violence to intimidate and punish opponents, their family members, and "
women human rights defenders. This was evident in the suppression of civilian 
"demonstrations in Myanmar and the Sudan, including through the threat and use of "
"rape and gang rape. In  some cases, protesters seeking refuge from violent crowd "
dispersals were pursued by security forces and subjected to sexual violence. In the 
"Syrian Arab Republic, such violence continued to be used as a tactic to stifle political "
"dissent and as a form of torture in detention settings. In Libya, women human rights "
defenders were targeted with threats of sexual violence and subjected to rape in 
"detention. Similarly, credible reports of rape and other forms of sexual violence used "
as a tool of political repre ssion emerged in the Islamic Republic of Iran in the context 
"of civic unrest and popular protests. Globally, women human rights defenders, "
"including those advocating on behalf of  victims of sexual violence, have been targeted "
with attacks aimed at stemming  their activism and participation in public life 
"(S/2022/740 ), perpetuating a vicious cycle of enforced silence and heightened "
vulnerability.  
14. Conflict -related sexual vi olence continued to propel both internal and cross -
"border displacement, with displaced and refugee women and girls exposed to "
"heightened risks. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mozambique, Somalia "
S/2023/413   
 
23-08418  6/35 
" and the Sudan, women and girls were sexually assaul ted by armed men in and around "
"displacement sites. Migrant and refugee women and girls in conflict -affected settings, "
"particularly those held in detention facilities, faced heightened risks of sexual "
"violence, notably in Libya and Yemen. Climate -related di splacement and insecurity, "
"triggered by flooding in South Sudan and drought in Somalia, exacerbated "
"competition for scarce resources, which increased intercommunal violence, including "
"sexual violence. In Somalia, 50 per cent of the cases of sexual violence  documented "
"in 2022 affected women and girls who had been displaced by climate shocks, leading "
"the Minister of Women, Human Rights and Child Development in Galmudug State to "
establish a dedicated “watch desk” to monitor such risks. In almost all settings 
"covered in the present report, women and girls were attacked in the course of "
"livelihood activities, such as farming or collecting water. Girls were also targeted on "
"their way to and from school. In Afghanistan, restrictions on women’s participation "
in all facets of life coupled with a deepening humanitarian crisis caused many families 
"to resort to negative coping mechanisms, such as forced and child marriage, in the "
face of financial desperation.  
"15. Sexual violence and exploitation in the context of abduct ion and trafficking, "
"including by United Nations -designated terrorist groups, continued to be observed in "
several conflict -affected settings where the rule of law and State authority remained 
"weak. In these contexts, sexual violence was used to consolidate  control of territory "
and/or as part of local illegal economies sustaining armed groups. In order to gain 
"control of natural resources and mining sites, armed groups operating in eastern "
Democratic Republic of the Congo abducted and sexually assaulted civi lians so as to 
drive them from contested areas. Migrant and refugee women and girls transiting 
through Libya have been preyed upon by traffickers for the purposes of sexual 
"exploitation. In Ukraine, the armed conflict triggered a large scale displacement, "
which led to increased risks of trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation in 
"the region. In Haiti, in a context of collapsed rule of law and corruption, gangs have "
"regularly kidnapped women and girls, in some cases filming victims being raped so "
"as to put pressure on relatives to pay ransoms. In South Sudan, abductions of women "
"and girls for the purpose of sexual exploitation increased in 2022, with rape and gang "
rape being exploited as a reward for men engaged in the fighting and used as a means 
"of collective punishment against rival ethnic groups, provoking displacement and "
"unravelling the social fabric ( A/HRC/49/CRP.4 ). In Somalia, Al -Shabaab has "
"subjugated areas under its control through the abduction, rape and forced marriage of "
local girls to  its fighters when the girls’ families were unable to meet extortion 
"demands. In the Central African Republic, the Lord’s Resistance Army continued to "
"abduct women and girls for the purpose of sexual slavery, as a result of which victims "
"and their children , including those born into captivity, suffered devastating physical "
"and psychological repercussions. Similarly, in Cabo Delgado, Mozambique, reported "
violations by non -State armed groups against civilians included the rape and 
abduction of women and child ren for purposes including sexual slavery. In Libya and 
"the Syrian Arab Republic, women and children held in captivity due to their perceived "
affiliation with Da’esh remain in detention or in situations of protracted displacement 
"where they are vulnerable to further sexual and other violence. In several cases, Iraqi "
Yazidi survivors of abduction and sexual slavery were compelled to leave their 
"children behind in the Syrian Arab Republic, in some instances placing them in "
institutional care owing to the prev ailing social stigma.  
"16. Survivors of conflict -related sexual violence are not a homogenous group, hence "
"the need for an intersectional analysis and a tailored, survivor -centred approach. The "
"present report documents cases against women, girls, men, boys  and persons with "
"diverse sexual orientations and gender identities, as well as persons living with "
"disabilities, ranging in age from 4 to over 80 years of age, with the majority coming "
from socioeconomically marginalized communities. While women and girls  continue 
 S/2023 /413 
 
7/35 23-08418  
" to constitute the vast majority of victims, men, boys and gender non -conforming "
persons are also affected. Male survivors tend to speak about sexual violence in terms 
"of torture, owing to patriarchal constructs and social norms around honour and "
masculine invulnerability. Most of the reported incidents of sexual violence against 
"men and boys occurred in detention settings, and included threats of rape, genital "
"injuries, and being forced to witness the rape of others. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, "
"transg ender, queer and intersex persons were at serious risk of sexual violence in "
"conflict -affected and displacement settings, including as a form of persecution. With "
regard to women and girls who become pregnant as a result of sexual violence in 
"conflict and children born of such sexual violence, the publication of my special "
"report ( S/2022/77 ) resulted in greater attention being focused on the issue, including "
"in the form of more  tailored responses. For instance, in South Sudan, women and girls "
"released from circumstances of abduction, as well as children who were born as a "
"result of rape perpetrated in the context of abduction, received dedicated assistance "
"and care. In Mali, sup port was provided to women and girls who became pregnant as "
a result of rape and to children born of rape. In order to focus attention on addressing 
"the ongoing stigma, insecurity and socioeconomic isolation faced by survivors and "
"children born of conflict -related rape, the Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict "
Initiative in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland convened a 
"global conference in November 2022, which served to highlight the multifaceted "
impact of sexual violence on survivor s in all their diversity.  
"17. Stigma, rooted in harmful social norms, continued to result in socioeconomic "
"exclusion and impoverishment being experienced by survivors. In several settings, "
"violations perpetrated in front of family members, including child ren, unravelled "
"family ties and networks, thereby accentuating the isolation of survivors and "
"impeding their reintegration. In Somalia, the  Sexual Offences Bill of 2018, which was "
"approved by the cabinet, continued to elicit a strong backlash, with some cl erics "
"seeking to characterize it as contrary to sharia law. In Mali, survivors who publicly "
"testified before the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission have experienced "
"further stigmatization. In an encouraging development, the sustained engagement o f "
the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali 
(MINUSMA) with the Islamic High Council culminated in the signing of a fatwa in 
"January 2023, which emphasized the prohibition of conflict -related sexual violence, "
the need to h old perpetrators accountable and the importance of community -level 
"support and solidarity with survivors and their children, including children born of "
"conflict -related rape. In June 2022, my Special Representative signed a framework of "
cooperation with Re ligions for Peace to promote interfaith dialogue on the scourge of 
conflict -related sexual violence in order to counter harmful social norms and the 
ensuing stigmatization of survivors.  
"18. Impunity for conflict -related sexual violence remains the norm, w ith the vacuum "
in terms of formal accountability often resulting in recourse to customary justice. The 
formal justice system is inaccessible for many survivors owing to a lack of legal aid 
"and long distances to competent authorities, with the security risk s and costs "
"associated with travel often proving prohibitive. In many settings, victims declined "
"to lodge a complaint owing to fear of reprisals and stigma, as noted in Libya and Mali. "
"In addition, judicial officials, including law enforcement personnel, f aced reprisals "
"for their efforts to investigate and prosecute conflict -related sexual violence, as "
"documented in Haiti. In an encouraging development, in October 2022, the Special "
"Criminal Court in the Central African Republic delivered its first verdict, convicting "
"a commander of the armed group, Retour, réclamation et réhabilitation, for rape "
"perpetrated by his subordinates, on the basis of command responsibility. In April 2022, "
"the case of Ali Muhammad Ali Abd -Al-Rahman, an alleged Janjaweed leader accus ed "
"of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur, including two counts of rape as "
"a crime against humanity and a war crime, proceeded to trial before the International "
S/2023/413   
 
23-08418  8/35 
" Criminal Court. In December 2022, the International Criminal Court confirmed the "
"conviction and sentencing of Dominic Ongwen, a former member of the Lord’s "
"Resistance Army, for war crimes and crimes against humanity, which included "
"charges of sexual and gender -based violence, such as forced marriage and forced "
"pregnancy. In terms of rep arative justice, in Colombia, the landmark final report of "
"the Commission for the Clarification of Truth, Coexistence and Non -Repetition, "
"issued in June 2022, offered specific recommendations to State institutions to provide "
transformative reparations for survivors and to ensure guarantees of non -repetition. 
"In December 2022, the Parliament of the Democratic Republic of the Congo adopted "
a law on protection and reparations for victims of conflict -related sexual violence and 
established a reparations scheme.  A national commission was subsequently created to 
"outline the terms of eligibility for reparations and establish a national fund. In Mali, "
the transitional authorities promulgated a law in November that covers both survivors 
and children born of conflict -related rape and authorizes compensation for damages 
"resulting from serious human rights violations, including coverage of medical costs "
"for the treatment of sexually transmitted infections, reconstructive surgery and "
rehabilitation.  
"19. Overall, the level  of compliance by parties to conflict with applicable "
international norms remained low despite the robust framework put in place by the 
"Security Council since 2008, including through its resolutions 1888  (2009) , 1960 "
"(2010) , 2106 (2013)  and 2467 (2019) . Over 70 per cent of the parties listed in the "
"present report are persistent perpetrators, which means they have appeared in the "
annex for five or more years wi thout taking remedial or corrective action. It is critical 
to enhance coherence between the practice of listing and the designation of parties 
"for the imposition of targeted and graduated measures, in order to leverage "
behavioural change and open space for  dialogue on protection. The Security Council 
"unanimously adopted resolution 2653 (2022) , which established a sanctions regime "
"with respect to Haiti, including an asset freeze, travel ban and arms embargo on "
"individuals and entities responsible for or complicit in acts, including acts of sexual "
"violence, tha t threaten the peace, security or stability of the country. Parties have also "
been sanctioned for sexual violence on a bilateral and regional basis. For parties that 
have made commitments in the form of joint or unilateral communiqués or 
"frameworks of coop eration, the level of implementation remains limited, though some "
"encouraging developments were observed. In Somalia, in September 2022, the Prime "
Minister launched a national action plan for the implementation of Security Council 
"resolution 1325 (2000) , developed with the support of the United Nations, which "
incorporated priorities set out in the 2013 joint communiqué on ending sexual 
"violence in conflict. On 28 June 20 22, the President of the Central African Republic "
validated the national action plan to prevent and respond to gender -based violence 
"linked to conflict, which followed last year’s appointment of a dedicated Special "
Adviser to the President on conflict -related sexual violence.  
20. Harnessing the preventive power of the rule of law is essential to deterring 
sexual violence and ensuring that women’s rights to safe and effective participation 
"in public life, as well as in peacebuilding and reconciliation proces ses, are fully "
realized. Security sector and law enforcement actors are on the frontline of the 
response. Vetting of the armed and security forces to exclude individuals credibly 
suspected or convicted of these crimes is therefore critical to fostering pub lic trust in 
"national institutions. Though this aspect of security sector reform is often neglected, "
"there has been some progress, including in South Sudan, with the adoption of an "
"action plan that includes provisions on the vetting and exclusion of perpet rators, and "
"in Somalia, where police forces have implemented vetting guidelines in recruitment "
processes. While such measures can enhance both the credibility of national security 
"forces and their effective functioning, challenges persist in strengthening security "
sector capacity to prevent and address sexual violence during and in the wake of 
 S/2023 /413 
 
9/35 23-08418  
" conflict. For instance, the policies and practices of customs and border officials are "
"sometimes gender -blind, though they can play a critical role in detecting and d eterring "
"conflict -driven trafficking, including for the purpose of sexual exploitation. It is also "
well established that the participation of women increases the durability and prospects 
"for success of peace processes, including their likelihood of effecti vely addressing "
"conflict -related sexual violence. In 2022, one ceasefire agreement explicitly included "
"the cessation of sexual violence by the parties, namely the agreement reached in "
"Ethiopia. As compared with the emergency response to crises, the global investment "
"in prevention, resilience -building and strengthening the rule of law remains a "
relatively neglected area. As we pass the midpoint for implementation of the 2030 
"Agenda for Sustainable Development, in which some of the Sustainable Development "
"Goals link gender equality with strong institutions and inclusive peacebuilding, we "
must ensure that no one is left behind in benefiting from the dividends of peace and 
"development, including the survivors of conflict -related sexual violence.   "
 
 
 III. Sexual violence in conflict -affected settings  
 
 
  Afghanistan  
 
"21. In 2022, the Taliban de facto authorities progressively erased women and girls "
from public life. The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in 
Afghanistan received reports that girls were forced to marry members of the Taliban 
in an effort to ensure safety for families ( A/HRC/51/6 ). Extreme poverty exacerbated 
"harmful coping mechanisms, including f orced marriage, as women and girls were "
deprived of educational and economic opportunities owing to discriminatory 
restrictions on their employment and mobility. Women and girls from ethnic 
"minorities, those living with disabilities, widows, and heads of h ousehold were at "
particular risk. Women were harassed and arbitrarily detained in the context of 
"protests, which were met with disproportionate force. Against this backdrop, data on "
"sexual violence remained difficult to obtain owing to fear of reprisals, p ervasive "
"impunity and entrenched gender inequality, all of which have been exacerbated since "
"the Taliban takeover. In 2022, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan "
(UNAMA) verified 30 cases of conflict -related sexual violence affecting 16 girl s and 
"14 boys. The cases included rape, forced marriage and bacha bazi , a practice "
involving the sexual abuse of young boys by men in positions of power.   
"22. National institutions, ranging from special courts for the prosecution of violence "
"against women to shelters, have been dismantled by the de facto authorities. In a "
"report by UNAMA covering the period from 15 August 2021 to 15 June 2022, it was "
"noted that none of the more than 80 cases of murder, rape, suicide, forced and child "
"marriage, assault and “ honour” killings that had been documented since August 2021 "
had been prosecuted by the formal justice system. Women were barred from practising 
"law or serving in the justice system, and sitting judges have refused to consider "
"women’s complaints, with instr uctions to resolve “family issues” through traditional "
"dispute resolution mechanisms. Despite these challenges, humanitarian service "
"providers delivered psychosocial support, skills training and specialized referrals to "
"47,199 women, girls and boys who had  suffered or were at risk of sexual and gender -"
"based violence, and trained some 363 social workers on gender -based violence case "
management. The decree issued by the de facto authorities in December 2022 banning 
women from working in non -governmental organ izations hampered the provision of 
"humanitarian assistance and support, including services to address gender -based "
violence. That decree resulted in 68 per cent of non -governmental organizations being 
compelled to reduce their operations and 15 per cent su spending them entirely. Less 
than half of the safe spaces for women and girls that operated across the country in 
2021 remained operational by the end of 2022.

   Recommendation  
 
23. I call upon the Taliban de facto authorities to respect the rights and fr eedoms of 
"Afghan women and girls,  including access to education, employment and "
participation in all spheres of public and political life. I urge the de facto authorities 
to ensure that women’s rights defenders and humanitarian service providers are able 
"to conduct their critical work safely and effectively, including the delivery of "
"specialized services to address gender -based violence, and to ensure that human rights "
"violations, including cases of sexual and gender -based violence, are duly monitored.  "
 
  Central African Republic  
 
24. While the security situation improved in certain regions following the 
"redeployment of national defence and security forces, armed groups that were "
dispersed by government counter -offensives to remote areas perpetrated a rang e of 
"violations, including sexual violence. In the north -east and north -west, armed groups "
took advantage of the security vacuum to increase the frequency of their attacks. By 
"December 2022, 515,665 Central Africans had been internally displaced and 738,79 3 "
had taken refuge in neighbouring countries. Monitoring sexual violence remained 
"challenging owing to widespread impunity, the fear of reprisals and the paucity of "
services. The United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in 
the Centr al African Republic (MINUSCA) documented 191 cases of conflict -related 
"sexual violence affecting 83 women, 105 girls and 3 men. An additional 92 allegations "
"are still under investigation, indicating that the number of violations is likely much "
higher. Sign atories to the 2019 Political Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in 
the Central African Republic continued to flagrantly use sexual violence as a tactic to 
"terrorize and displace communities, in violation of the terms of the agreement. Retour, "
"réclamat ion et réhabilitation, Front populaire pour la renaissance de la Centrafrique "
"(FPRC), Unité pour la paix en Centrafrique (UPC) and anti -balaka, all affiliated with "
"Coalition des patriotes pour le changement (CPC), were the main perpetrators among "
"non-State  armed groups, targeting primarily women and girls, who were particularly "
at risk while fleeing attacks or conducting livelihood activities. Despite being 
"dispersed from its stronghold,  Retour, réclamation et réhabilitation continued to "
"pursue brutal tacti cs in the area, with some victims reporting being gang -raped by "
"five or more of its members. Moreover, CPC elements reportedly gang -raped a "
"woman, who succumbed to the injuries sustained during this attack, after accusing "
her of having a relationship with a member of the national armed forces. In terms of 
"State actors, members of the national defence and security forces were implicated in "
"25 cases, the majority of them committed against girls. Other security personnel, "
"either acting alone or jointly with th e national forces, were responsible for seven cases "
"of conflict -related sexual violence, including rape and sexual slavery, which resulted "
in pregnancy in at least one recorded instance.   
"25. In terms of efforts to combat impunity, the extension of State a uthority to parts "
"of Mbomou Prefecture allowed MINUSCA, and subsequently the justice sector, to "
investigate patterns of conflict -related sexual violence perpetrated by FPRC and UPC 
"between December 2020 and March 2022. In this context, MINUSCA documented "
"245 violations, including rape, attempted rape and sexual slavery, affecting 146 "
women and 99 girls. The investigation established the direct responsibility of 
"Mahamat Salleh, FPRC zone commander, in cases of rape, along with Abdoulaye "
"Machai, member of UPC . The joint rapid response unit to prevent sexual violence "
against women and children carried out an investigation into these events in early 
"2022, which led to the referral of 77 cases to the prosecutor in June. Following public "
"outreach regarding the inv estigation, an additional 400 survivors of conflict -related "
"sexual violence approached the unit to testify. In December 2022, the file was "
transmitted by the national authorities to the Office of the Prosecutor of the Special 
 S/2023 /413 
 
11/35 23-08418  
 Criminal Court. A further 19 c ases of sexual violence have been tried in the Bangui 
"and Bouar courts of appeal. The Truth, Justice, Reparation and Reconciliation "
"Commission, established in 2021, finalized legal and internal documents and began "
"to conduct an awareness -raising campaign r egarding the transitional justice process, "
with strategic and operational support from MINUSCA.  
"26. United Nations entities, in coordination with Government counterparts, "
"continued to deliver survivor -centred services, such as remote case management and "
"psychosocial support, including through a toll -free hotline. Nevertheless, chronic "
"gaps persist in terms of sexual and reproductive health care, HIV prevention, mental "
"health care, and access to justice and livelihood support, in particular in rural and "
"remo te areas, where access is constrained by limited infrastructure. The Ministry of "
"Justice, with United Nations support, convened a capacity -building workshop for 80 "
judges and police officers on the effective investigation and prosecution of conflict -
"relate d sexual violence. In 2022, the Defence Headquarters  committed to engage with "
"MINUSCA and other partners to strengthen accountability within, and the oversight "
"of, the national defence and security forces, in line with the 2019 joint communiqué, "
further to  the listing of the national armed forces in the annex to my previous report 
(S/2022/272 ).  
 
  Recommendation  
 
"27. I reiterate my call for all parties to cease all forms of sexual violence, in line "
"with their obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law, and "
urge them to recommit to the 2019 Political Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation. 
I urge the authorities to effectively address conflict -related sexual violence within the 
"national defence and security forces, including through effective vetting and "
accountability measures.   
 
  Colombia  
 
"28. The reporting period saw renewed focus on the consolidation of peace, including "
"the launch of the to tal peace policy outlined by the President, Gustavo Petro Urrego, "
"in August, which led to exploratory dialogues with non -State armed groups, including "
"Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN). Despite this important progress, the "
implementation of the gender -related provisions of the Final Agreement for Ending 
the Conflict and Building a Stable and Lasting Peace between the Government of 
Colombia and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia -Ejército del Pueblo 
"(FARC -EP) remained uneven, and violence sur ged in certain areas. Armed groups "
"continued to use sexual violence as a tactic to consolidate territorial control, instil "
"fear and obtain information. In 2022, the  Victims’ Unit recorded 453 cases of conflict -"
"related sexual violence affecting 391 women, 2 6 men, 20 girls, 12 persons of diverse "
"sexual orientation and gender identity and 4 boys. Among the victims, 160 were "
Afro -Colombians and 30 were individuals from Indigenous communities. Most of 
"these cases were reported in the Departments of Chocó, Cauca,  Norte de Santander "
and Valle del Cauca. The main perpetrators were criminal and illegal armed groups 
"(209 cases), while in over 180 cases, the perpetrator could not be identified. In 2022, "
the early warning system from the Office of the Ombudsman issued 2 0 warnings 
identifying illegal armed groups and transnational armed groups as the source of 
"threats of conflict -related sexual violence, including human trafficking for the "
"purpose of sexual exploitation, particularly targeting refugee and migrant women an d "
"girls. Conflict -related sexual violence was reported in border areas, as well as in "
"Indigenous and Afro -Colombian communities. In 2022, the United Nations "
"documented 46 new allegations, affecting 26 girls, 19 women and 1 man, which "
constitutes an increas e of 59 per cent compared with the previous reporting period. 
Victims included Indigenous and Afro -Colombian women and girls. The violations 
S/2023/413   
 
23-08418  12/35 
" included rape, sexual slavery, forced marriage and forced contraception, and "
"implicated members of dissident groups  of the former FARC -EP, ELN, and the Clan "
del Golfo (also known as Autodefensas Gaitanistas de Colombia). State security 
"forces were also involved. Structural gender inequality, a lack of education and "
"poverty rendered girls vulnerable to recruitment, sexu al exploitation and forced "
"marriage. In three cases recorded in 2022, the forced recruitment of girls resulted in "
"forced pregnancies. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex persons "
"remained at high risk of sexual violence, especially in r ural, conflict -affected areas "
where illegal armed groups enforce patriarchal social norms through violence.  
"29. Barriers to reporting and seeking redress persisted, namely death threats by "
"illegal armed groups, stigmatization, the lack of protection measu res for victims and "
"witnesses, and the costs of accessing justice. Indigenous women and girls continued "
"to face additional challenges in this regard, as did lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, "
"queer and intersex persons, and persons living with disabiliti es, particularly in rural "
and remote areas. Survivors of conflict -related sexual violence who had migrated 
from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela faced difficulties in obtaining recognition 
"as victims of armed conflict, which limited their access to ass istance. In October, to "
"help address those issues and improve access to justice and services, the Government "
announced the launch of its inaugural national action plan on women and peace and 
"security, to be developed in close consultation with women’s orga nizations.  "
"30. In order to combat impunity, in 2022, the Office of the Attorney -General "
"initiated 52 criminal proceedings related to conflict -related sexual violence, including "
"one case of forced abortion and 51 cases of rape, of which 34 were committed against "
"women, 12  against children and 5 against men. Two individuals have been indicted "
"to date, with investigations ongoing in the remaining cases. Through Order 103 issued "
"in June, the Special Jurisdiction for Peace launched a process to formally open a "
dedicated case o n conflict -related sexual violence. The National Victims’ Unit 
"provided reparations to 547 victims, while the Office of the Ombudsman expanded "
its presence at the local level and provided referrals to counselling and other 
"specialized services to 83 surviv ors, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, "
"queer and intersex individuals. In April 2022, Colombian journalist and survivor, "
"Jineth Bedoya Lima, was nominated by my Special Representative to serve as a global "
champion for the fight against sexual violence in conflict.  
 
  Recommendation  
 
31. I reiterate my call for the authorities to accelerate the full implementation of 
gender -related provisions of the peace agreement. I commend the work of the 
transitional justice system in Colombia and welcome t he efforts by the Special 
Jurisdiction for Peace on the opening of a case on conflict -related sexual violence and 
call for the full implementation of the Truth Commission’s recommendations on 
reparations for victims of sexual violence. I commend the Govern ment on its concrete 
"steps to formulate a national action plan on women and peace and security, and "
"encourage the authorities to include budgeted, operational measures to prevent and "
address conflict -related sexual violence.   
 
  Democratic Republic of the Congo  
 
32. The security and humanitarian situation in eastern Democratic Republic of the 
"Congo deteriorated significantly owing to persistent attacks by armed groups, "
including in the context of the resurgence of Mouvement du 23 mars (M23) armed 
"group, co ntinued military operations, against the backdrop of the state of siege, and "
"rising tensions in the region. By the end of 2022, armed hostilities have displaced "
"more than 467,000 civilians in North Kivu Province, exacerbating risks of conflict -"
related sexu al violence by both non -State and State actors. Long -standing challenges 
 S/2023 /413 
 
13/35 23-08418  
" for survivors in terms of reporting incidents and gaining access to services, including "
"fear of retaliation, stigma and limited infrastructure, were exacerbated by emerging "
"challenges . For instance, inflammatory rhetoric against MONUSCO, including "
"violent demonstrations, narrowed the operating space for service delivery and "
"verification of allegations.  Accordingly, reported cases likely represent only a fraction "
of actual violations.  
"33. In 2022, MONUSCO documented 701 cases of conflict -related sexual violence, "
"affecting 503 women, 187 girls and 11 men. Of that total, 21 reported cases affecting "
13 girls and 8 women dated back to previous years. Most violations occurred in the 
context of clashes between armed groups and the Armed Forces of the Democratic 
"Republic of the Congo, in addition to retaliatory attacks against civilians by both State "
and non -State actors. The majority (550 cases) were attributed to non -State armed 
"groups. State  actors accounted for the remaining 148 cases, including 108 perpetrated "
"by the Armed Forces, with girls accounting for 50 per cent of the victims; 28 by the "
Congolese National Police; and 12 by other State actors. The proximity of armed men 
"to civilian po pulation centres increased the risk of sexual violence, with over half of "
"such attacks perpetrated by the  Armed Forces occurring in North Kivu, where units "
were deployed to counter the threat of M23. The National Police continued to be 
"implicated in patter ns of sexual violence, including against individuals detained in "
"police custody. In South Kivu, the United Nations documented three cases of sexual "
"violence attributed to the Burundi National Defence Force, which participates in joint "
military operations a gainst armed groups.  
34. Sexual violence was often perpetrated during raids on villages in retaliation for 
perceived collaboration with rival armed groups or with State forces. Such attacks in 
"North Kivu were mainly attributed to Nyatura factions, account ing for 19 per cent of "
"the total number of cases documented. In 2022, 42 verified cases were attributed to "
"M23 elements, though the actual number is likely higher, given that the lack of access "
"to areas under their control impeded the verification of alleg ations. In South Kivu, "
"Mai-Mai Raia Mutomboki remained active, with one faction abducting and gang -"
"raping 10 women, despite the arrest and conviction of faction leaders. Mai -Mai "
"factions also continued to ambush roads and abduct women and girls. For instan ce, "
"in Tanganyika, Mai -Mai Perci Moto carried out mass abductions and rape, including "
"the rape of 16 women during an attack on a mining site. In Ituri, despite engagement "
"in a demobilization process, 11 members of Force de résistance patriotique de l’Ituri  "
tortured and raped seven women. A total of 82 documented violations were attributed 
"to Coopérative pour le développement du Congo, representing an increase in attacks "
against civilians as compared with the previous reporting period.  
35. In cases involvin g conflict -related sexual violence monitored by the United 
"Nations, judicial authorities prosecuted and convicted 22 members of the Armed "
"Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 11 members of the Congolese "
National Police and 18 civilian men in 202 2. The United Nations conducted 10 joint 
"missions to investigate violations, including conflict -related sexual violence, in the "
"Provinces of North Kivu and South Kivu, and supported the organization of six "
"mobile courts. In July, the Prime Minister approve d the creation of a task force to "
accelerate the implementation of the 2019 addendum to the joint communiqué on 
"addressing conflict -related sexual violence. In December 2022, the Parliament "
adopted a law on protection and reparations for victims of conflic t-related sexual 
violence and established a reparations scheme. MONUSCO continued to engage with 
the Office of the Special Adviser to the President for Youth and the Fight Against 
"Violence against Women, as well as with the national armed and security forc es to "
provide training to specialized police units and support the creation of a police 
database on sexual violence cases.  
 
S/2023/413   
 
23-08418  14/35 
   Recommendation  
 
36. I urge the authorities to accelerate implementation of the addendum to the joint 
"communiqué, including throug h the action plans to address conflict -related sexual "
violence by the national armed and security forces. I further call upon the Government 
to ensure that the law on protection and reparations for victims is in line with 
"international standards, to alloca te adequate resources to the reparations fund for "
"timely disbursement, and to ensure a survivor -centred and trauma -informed approach "
in its implementation.  
 
  Iraq  
 
"37. In a volatile political and security context, despite the limited reach of services, "
"cases of conflict -related sexual violence continued to be reported. In 2022, the United "
Nations provided services in the Kurdistan Region to survivors of sexual violence 
committed during the 2014 conflict. Survivors from a range of minority groups have 
"begu n to disclose their experiences, with 22 cases affecting Turkmen and Shabak "
women documented in 2022. There is also emerging evidence that Da’esh committed 
"sexual violence against men. Moreover, the United Nations Investigative Team to "
Promote Accountabili ty for Crimes Committed by Da’esh/ Islamic State in Iraq and 
the Levant (UNITAD) has compiled evidence indicating that a number of individuals 
were raped and killed on the basis of their actual or perceived gender identity. As part 
"of the process of return  of Iraqi nationals from Hawl camp in the Syrian Arab Republic, "
"914 families, of which 70 per cent are female -headed households, returned to their "
"places of origin in Iraq, where they often face stigma owing to suspected affiliation "
with Da’esh and as a re sult of structural gender inequality. According to the 
Directorate of Yazidi Affairs of the Ministry of Endowment and Religious Affairs of 
"the Kurdistan Regional Government, of the estimated 6,417 Yazidis who were "
"abducted, 3,561 (1,207 women, 1,059 girls,  956 boys, and 339 men) have been "
"rescued. These figures, however, do not include other affected groups, such as the "
"Turkmen. Among the female Yazidi survivors who returned from Da’esh captivity, "
more than 430 remain in displacement sites grappling with si gnificant mental health 
"and socioeconomic challenges. Survivors and their children, including children born "
"of rape, are often unable to obtain birth registration and identity documents, as Iraqi "
law requires proof of paternity.  
38. The Government approve d a budget of $19 million to finance reparations 
"pursuant to the Law on Support to Female Yazidi Survivors, with some 2,000 "
"applications submitted since September 2022, including through an online platform "
"established by the General Directorate for Survivo rs Affairs. Despite persistent needs, "
cuts in humanitarian funding have reduced the footprint of service providers working 
to address gender -based violence and curtailed support for survivors. Despite this 
"challenging context, the United Nations provided s ervices for addressing gender -"
"based violence to over 3,750 refugees and 4,000 internally displaced persons. The "
General Directorate for Survivors Affairs has supported the delivery of psychosocial 
assistance for survivors experiencing severe trauma. The Un ited Nations Assistance 
Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) convened a series of focus groups with over 100 female 
"survivors from Yazidi, Turkmen and Shabak communities, who consistently "
highlighted the need for income -generating opportunities. Ongoing prosecutions a nd 
convictions of Da’esh affiliates have yet to include charges of sexual violence.  
 
  Recommendation  
 
39. I welcome the progress made by the Government in implementing the Law on 
Support to Female Yazidi Survivors and call for its scope to be expanded to include 
"children born of conflict -related rape, and to enact legislation that renders all children "
 S/2023 /413 
 
15/35 23-08418  
" eligible  for birth registration and documentation. I urge the Government, in line with "
"the joint communiqué to address conflict -related sexual violence, to ensure continuity "
"of multisectoral services for survivors, as well as long -term reintegration support.  "
 
  Libya 
 
"40. Persistent divisions among Libyan political actors, sporadic clashes between "
"armed groups, illicit arms proliferation and weak institutional capacity created an "
environment conducive to the perpetration of conflict -related sexual violence with 
impunity. In a context where harmful social norms related to honour and victim -
"blaming remain entrenched, women human rights defenders in Libya continued to be "
"targeted, including with sexual violence, as part of efforts to silence them and "
"dissuade others fr om participating in public life. For instance, despite calls by United "
"Nations special procedures mandate holders for her release, a prominent advocate and "
"activist, Iftikhar Boudra, remained in detention, where she has reportedly suffered "
"prolonged physic al, sexual and psychological abuse ( A/HRC/50/63 ). "
41. The United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) verified 23 cases of 
"conflict -related sexual violence, including rape and forced prostitution, perpetrated "
"against 11 women (6 of whom were migrants) , as well as against 5 men and 7 girls. "
Threats and incidents of sexual violence persisted in detention centres to which 
humanitarian access remained severely restricted. UNSMIL continued to receive 
reports of violations perpetrated in the Mitiga prison un der the control of the 
"Deterrence Apparatus for Combating Organized Crime and Terrorism, including rape, "
"ill-treatment and torture. Sixty -four women and their children, who were detained for "
"their alleged affiliation with Da’esh, continued to be held in th e Kuwayfiyah military "
prison and in the Judaydah prison. The Independent Fact -Finding Mission on Libya 
"continued to receive reports of detainees being threatened with sexual violence, "
stripped and/or subjected to intrusive body searches amounting to rape ( A/HRC/49/4 ). 
"Furthermore, the Fact -Finding Mission documented instances of sexualized torture "
and cases of women being arrested and subjected to threats and acts of sexual v iolence 
"in order to force male relatives to surrender themselves ( A/HRC/50/63 ). Similarly, a "
woman who was arrested after refusing sex with members of the Criminal 
Investigation Directorate  subsequently accused her sister of so -called “moral 
"offences”. In most of these cases, survivors declined to lodge an official complaint "
owing to the fear of reprisals and intimidation.  
"42. Patterns of conflict -related sexual violence, including rape and forced "
"prostitution against migrants, refugees and asylum seekers,  continued to be "
"perpetrated by traffickers, smugglers and armed men. State actors were also involved. "
"The Masked Men armed group, created in 2013 ostensibly to combat smuggling and "
"later integrated into the Ministry of Defence, was implicated in the rape of migrant "
"girls. Members of the Directorate for Combating Illegal Migration, as well as "
"elements of non -State armed groups, perpetrated sexual violence as a tactic of control "
"and torture, in some cases resulting in the death of the victim. The Panel of Ex perts "
"on Libya continued to document instances of rape and sexual slavery, often committed "
by multiple perpetrators in a secret detention facility in Bani Walid controlled by 
networks of human traffickers ( S/2022/427 ). Female migrants were routinely held in 
detention centres without female guards and strip -searched by male guards. They 
"reported a lack of access to services for addressing gender -based violence, including "
"sexual and reproductive health care. In some cases, migrants have been trafficked "
"internally and to third countries. In the Tazirbu camp in eastern Libya, which holds "
"some 200 asylum seekers and migrants, of whom over 100 are women and children, "
female detain ees reported being raped by Libyan officials and foreign nationals. 
Violations perpetrated against women and girls by Libyan and Sudanese traffickers 
"were also reported. In order to reinforce accountability, United Nations partners "
S/2023/413   
 
23-08418  16/35 
 provided capacity -buildi ng support to lawyers and military prosecutors on 
"international criminal justice and fair trial standards, including for cases of conflict -"
related sexual violence.  
 
  Recommendation  
 
43. I call upon the Libyan authorities to grant the United Nations unres tricted 
humanitarian access to detention facilities. I call upon the authorities to adopt 
anti-trafficking legislation and hold perpetrators accountable. I further call upon the 
"authorities to release all prisoners of conscience, women human rights defende rs, "
"migrants, asylum seekers and refugees who are arbitrarily detained, and to hold all "
perpetrators of sexual violence accountable and deliver multisectoral assistance to 
survivors.  
 
  Mali  
 
"44. In 2022, the security situation continued to deteriorate, a s violent extremist "
groups attempted to fill the security vacuum that followed the departure of the 
"international forces deployed as part of Operation Barkhane and Task Force Takuba, "
and the transitional Government’s withdrawal from the Group of Five for t he Sahel. 
Attacks on civilians persisted amid fighting between Al -Qaida and Islamic State -
affiliated groups in north -east and central Mali. The transitional authorities committed 
"to a two -year transition, while enduring governance challenges and limited St ate "
presence in conflict -affected areas exposed women and girls to sexual violence. The 
illicit proliferation of small arms and light weapons and intercommunal violence 
"propelled mass displacement, with displaced women and girls exposed to abduction, "
"kidna pping, forced marriage and trafficking.  "
"45. Despite widespread insecurity, which impeded humanitarian access and "
"reporting, the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in "
"Mali (MINUSMA) verified 98 cases of conflict -related sexual  violence, affecting 85 "
"women and 13 girls. As part of monitoring grave violations against children, the "
United Nations also verified incidents of rape and other forms of sexual violence 
"affecting 43 girls, mostly by unknown perpetrators. Humanitarian serv ice providers "
registered cases of sexual violence against 392 women and 294 girls. The perpetrators 
"were members of armed groups, including Coordination des mouvements de "
"l’Azawad (CMA), Mouvement pour le salut de l’Azawad des Daoussak, Groupe "
"d’autodéfens e des Touaregs Imghad et alliés, and Coordination des mouvements et "
"fronts patriotiques de résistance, as well as members of militia and self -defence "
"groups, such as Dan Nan Ambassagou and Ganda Izo. In some cases, the perpetrators "
were armed elements who could not be identified. Members of the Malian Defence 
and Security Forces were also allegedly implicated in reported violations. Of concern 
"is the increased use of sexual violence by militia and self -defence groups, in some "
instances fighting alongside th e national armed forces. The United Nations also 
documented cases in which foreign security personnel appear to have been allegedly 
"implicated in conflict -related sexual violence during military operations. For instance, "
"foreign security personnel deployed  in central Mali entered a village, from which men "
"had fled owing to fears of violent extremism, and allegedly raped local women and "
"girls in their homes, including two minors. Some victims received medical assistance "
"in Mopti, while others resettled outsi de the region. No official complaint was filed in "
"connection with this incident, which is indicative of the wider context, in which less "
"than 10 per cent of victims file judicial complaints, primarily owing to the proximity "
of militia groups and the relate d fear of reprisals.  
46. The United Nations continued to support the transitional authorities in 
implementing the action plan developed pursuant to the 2019 joint communiqué. 
MINUSMA also engaged with non -State armed groups on the implementation of 
 S/2023 /413 
 
17/35 23-08418  
" unilateral commitments to tackle  sexual violence, in particular CMA. With the "
"support of the United Nations, five additional one -stop centres were established in "
"existing health facilities in 2022, bringing their total number to 15 in the regional "
"capitals of Bamako, Kayes, Koulikoro, Sé gou, Gao, Mopti, Timbuktu and Sikasso "
"Regions. Nonetheless, access to multisectoral services remains severely limited, with "
survivors from remote areas compelled to travel vast distances to reach them. 
"According to assessments by service providers, in 2022 , 92 per cent of survivors of "
"sexual violence were unable to gain access to safe shelters, and 42 per cent were "
"unable to obtain medical support. Moreover, entrenched harmful social norms fuelled "
"discrimination, and in some cases further aggression, agains t survivors, some of "
"whom sought refuge in distant locations. Four emblematic cases, involving 146 "
"victims of conflict -related sexual violence from northern Mali, have been pending "
before the courts since 2013. MINUSMA has supported the training and capaci ty-
"building of both national judicial authorities, with a view to expediting such "
"proceedings, and police academy students on the prevention and response to conflict -"
related sexual violence. The transitional Government announced the opening of 
investigatio ns into violations of international humanitarian and human rights law 
"documented since the start of 2022, with the findings yet to be released ( S/2023/21 ). "
 
  Recommendation  
 
47. I urge the transitional authorities to expedite implementation of the joint 
"communiqué, to prioritize the cases of conflict -related sexual violence that have been "
"pending before the courts for a decade, and to investigate cases committed by national "
"armed forces, community -based militias and foreign security personnel. I further call "
upon the transitional authorities to ensure that the law on reparations is effectively 
implemented and that access to services for survivors is guaranteed.

"48. Civic space narrowed in the wake of the 2021 military takeover, with disturbing "
"reports of sexual violence committed against women, girls, men, boys and lesbian, "
"gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex persons continuing to emerge, "
including in t he course of military operations in Sagaing and Mandalay. As a result 
"of the military takeover, some 1.8 million people have been displaced, with 370,400 "
"persons remaining in protracted internal displacement. An estimated 49,700 civilians "
"fled to neighbour ing countries, while more than 900,000 Rohingya refugees continued "
"to reside in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, after fleeing persecution and military attacks "
by the Myanmar armed forces (Tatmadaw) in October 2016 and August 2017 
"following military “clearance” op erations, which included widespread and systematic "
conflict -related sexual violence.  
49. Continued arrests and arbitrary detention by the Myanmar armed forces of civil 
"society activists, journalists, and members of the National Unity Government led to "
widespread insecurity. Members of ethnic armed organizations and people’s defence 
"forces have also been targeted. Sexual violence was perpetrated in detention, against "
"women, men, boys and people of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities. "
The Speci al Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar reported that 
"since the military takeover, soldiers and police officers have sexually assaulted and "
harassed girls held in detention. Instances of online gender -based hate speech directed 
"at politic ally active women have also emerged. Moreover, armed conflict and "
"arbitrary arrests often resulted in the separation of children from their parents, "
exposing them to higher risks of forced marriage and human trafficking 
"(A/HRC/50/CRP.1 ). In the context of the ongoing conflict, all parties have been "
"implicated in sexual violence. For instance, armed actors aligned with the military, "
"including members of the Pyu Saw Htee militia, have been accused of committing "
S/2023/413   
 
23-08418  18/35 
 sexual violence. The United Nations verified inc idents committed against girls by 
ethnic armed organizations. Women who were unable to flee their villages during 
military attacks were allegedly raped by military personnel. The bodies of women 
who were reportedly executed extrajudicially by the military have been found with 
injuries consistent with sexual violence.  
50. In the context of a near -total collapse of public health care and judicial 
"institutions, existing support services were rendered largely inaccessible owing to "
"movement restrictions, teleco mmunications monitoring and surveillance. Health -care "
and legal professionals have been arbitrarily arrested and safehouses raided by 
undercover military personnel. A reluctance to report to international mechanisms and 
a breakdown of trust in national ins titutions contributed to violations going 
"unreported and unaddressed, even as humanitarian needs increased. In October 2022, "
"the de facto authorities adopted an amendment to the Organization Registration Law, "
which placed women human rights defenders at ri sk of imprisonment for not 
"registering their organizations. In December, the Security Council adopted resolution "
"2669 (2022)  on Myanmar, which urged the de facto autho rities to protect the rights "
of women and children and to ensure safe and unhindered humanitarian access.  
"51. In Cox’s Bazar, the United Nations continued to provide multisectoral services "
"in the camps, including for survivors of conflict -related sexual vi olence and their "
"children. In a context of limited economic opportunities, refugee women and girls are "
"at heightened risk of sexual exploitation by traffickers. In the camps, cases of sexual "
violence are generally referred to male camp leaders who favour t raditional dispute 
"resolution approaches and mechanisms, which include rape survivors being "
compelled to marry the perpetrators.  
 
  Recommendation  
 
52. I urge the Myanmar military to fully respect and implement Security Council 
"resolution 2669 (2022) , and further call upon them to immediately release all "
arbitrarily detained prisoners. I further call upon the military to allow immediate and 
unconstrained access to United Nations -mandated investigatory and reporting b odies 
"and to humanitarian actors providing support to affected populations, as well as to "
hold perpetrators of sexual violence accountable.   
 
  Somalia  
 
"53. Widespread insecurity and the dire humanitarian situation, resulting from "
"climate shocks such as drought, fuelled displacement, while competition for resources "
"amplified the risk of local tensions and conflicts. Against this backdrop, internally "
displaced women and girls were particularly vulnerable to conflict -related sexual 
"violence owing to protracted conflict, structural gender inequality and limited access "
to justice and services. Difficulties in accessing areas controlled by Al -Shabaab and 
"weak rule o f law, as well as clan protection for alleged perpetrators, all contributed "
to chronic underreporting. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia 
"(UNSOM) verified 19 cases of conflict -related sexual violence, including gang rape, "
"and attempted rape, perpetrated against 14 women and 5 girls. As part of monitoring "
"grave violations against children, the United Nations verified incidents of rape and "
other forms of sexual violence affecting 219 girls and 2 boys. Almost half of the 
"attacks occurred in isola ted areas, including village outskirts and farming fields, with "
55 girls attacked in or around displacement sites. Most incidents were attributed to 
"unidentified armed perpetrators, Al -Shabaab and clan militia. Government security "
"and police forces, as wel l as Jubbaland forces and Puntland forces, and the Ethiopian "
"Liyu Police, were also implicated in cases of sexual violence. Cases of conflict -"
related sexual violence reported to the Panel of Experts on Somalia in 2022 
demonstrate a link between inter -clan conflicts and the exposure of women and girls 
 S/2023 /413 
 
19/35 23-08418  
" to sexual violence. Moreover, in drought -affected communities, women and girls "
"were disproportionately exposed to forced marriage, including to members of "
Al-Shabaab ( S/2022/754 ). 
"54. In 2022, the climate of impunity persisted, with no prosecutions for conflict -"
"related sexual violence crimes taking place, despite complaints having been lodged. "
"Recourse to customary justice practice s, known as xeer, often resulted in decisions "
"that shielded perpetrators from criminal responsibility. In Puntland, traditional elders "
"continued to settle sexual violence cases with the knowledge of the authorities, "
although the Puntland Sexual Offences La w of 2016 requires such cases to be 
"adjudicated by the formal justice system. At the federal level, the cabinet -approved "
Sexual Offences Bill of 2018 continued to elicit a strong backlash from religious 
leaders and clan elders. UNSOM provided training to o fficers of the Somali Police 
Force from the Women and Child Protection Units in Mogadishu to strengthen their 
capacity to investigate sexual violence crimes.  
 
  Recommendation  
 
55. I reiterate my call upon the Federal Government to adopt legislative measur es 
that will strengthen the protection of all persons from sexual violence and to enhance 
"access to justice for survivors, including by increasing the number of Women and "
Child Protection Units in the Police Force and ensuring survivor -centred referral 
mechanisms. I further call upon the Federal Government to strengthen protection 
"measures for women and girls, including those who have been displaced by drought "
"and exposed to violence, and ensure that their needs are integrated into wider "
humanitarian respon se plans.  
 
  South Sudan  
 
"56. In 2022, the Government extended the transitional period, established under the "
terms of the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic 
"of South Sudan (signed in 2018), by two years. The first grad uation ceremonies of the "
"Necessary Unified Forces were held in August, though the forces lacked logistical "
"support, adequate training and an established  mechanism for vetting and removing "
from duty all members of the armed and security forces credibly susp ected of 
committing or being responsible for crimes of conflict -related sexual violence. 
"Moreover, the security situation deteriorated, as subnational violence surged, owing "
"to clashes between parties to the conflict, affiliated armed militias and splinter  groups, "
along with the systematic use of sexual violence as a tactic to punish and forcibly 
"displace populations. Fighting in southern Unity State, greater Upper Nile and Warrap "
"State resulted in attacks against civilians, including sexual violence. Some 44,000 "
civilians were forcibly displaced from southern Unity State alone. Large -scale 
"abductions of women and children, a tragic feature of the conflict, increased in 2022. "
"Climate -related shocks, such as flooding and drought, aggravated competition over "
"scarce resources. Cattle raiding in greater Jonglei, which expanded to the Equatoria "
"region, was accompanied by worsening intercommunal violence.  "
57. The United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) documented incidents 
of conflict -related sexual violenc e affecting 221 women and 71 girls. A further seven 
"attacks, which occurred between 2019 and 2021, affecting four women, two girls, and "
"one boy, were also verified in 2022. Perpetrators included non -State actors, such as "
"organized armed groups, civil defen ce groups and other armed elements. Government "
"security forces were also implicated, with 38 per cent of reported incidents attributed "
"to the South Sudan People’s Defence Forces, and 5 per cent to the South Sudan "
"National Police Service, the National Wildl ife Service and the National Security "
"Service. In addition, 8 per cent of cases were attributed to the Sudan People’s "
Liberation Army in Opposition. One case involved a member of the National 
S/2023/413   
 
23-08418  20/35 
" Salvation Front. Armed youth groups allied to the main parties t o the conflict, civil "
"defence groups, community -based militia and splinter groups accounted for 39 per "
cent of incidents. The remaining 10 per cent of reported cases were attributed to 
unidentified armed elements. Most documented incidents took place in so uthern 
"Unity State, Warrap State and greater Upper Nile and were perpetrated against "
"civilians ranging from 10 to 50 years of age. The reported incidents included rape, "
"attempted rape, gang rape, forced nudity, abduction for the purposes of sexual "
"exploita tion, forced marriage and sexual slavery. Pregnant women and lactating "
"mothers were among the victims, as were internally displaced persons and individuals "
living with disabilities. Women and girls were particularly vulnerable while carrying 
"out essential livelihood activities, fleeing villages and travelling to and from school. "
"In some cases, the victims were attacked at gunpoint and sustained severe physical "
injuries. Women reported advising their daughters on how to react during an attack in 
"order to red uce physical injuries, which is indicative of the prevalence and brutality "
"of sexual violence in South Sudan. Reports of pregnancies resulting from rape were, "
"in several cases, associated with abduction and sexual slavery. An investigation by "
"the United Na tions in southern Unity State revealed that sexual slavery, including "
"rape and gang rape, of abducted women and girls was used by the joint Government "
forces and allied militias as an incentive and reward for combatants. Members of civil 
"society organizati ons faced intimidation tactics, such as arbitrary detention and "
having their bank accounts frozen.  
58. My Special Representative visited South Sudan in October 2022 and met with 
senior Government officials to discuss expediting implementation of the 2014 j oint 
"communiqué, including through strengthening the legislative framework and "
"enhancing the protection of victims and witnesses, who continue to face reprisals. "
"Judges, defence lawyers and organizations working to support survivors have also "
"been subjecte d to intimidation. In terms of reparative justice, while civilian and "
"military courts award compensation to victims, the inability or unwillingness of the "
perpetrator to pay reparations often impedes disbursement to survivors. Given the 
"limited reach of th e justice system and the lack of access to remote areas, sexual "
"violence is often referred to customary authorities. Nonetheless, 13 individuals were "
convicted of sexual and gender -based crimes by a joint special mobile court operating 
"in Western Bahr el -Ghazal and Warrap States, as well as by a circuit court in Warrap "
State. A total of 10 Special Protection Units within the South Sudan National Police 
"Service, established since 2010, continued to operate across the country, though they "
"lack adequate resour ces. With respect to military justice, eight SSPDF elements, "
"including one former solider, were convicted in five cases involving sexual violence, "
"in the General Court Martial in Yei, in Central Equatoria State. In June 2022, a team "
focused on investigatin g and prosecuting conflict -related sexual violence was 
"established within the South Sudan People’s Defence Forces. To date, sexual violence "
has been examined under the penal code as an ordinary crime and has not yet been 
"tried as a war crime. Overall, the number of trials completed remains negligible "
relative to the scale of conflict -related sexual violence in South Sudan.  
"59. The lack of laboratories, equipment and medication, as well as the limited "
"number of qualified health -care personnel, impeded acces s to services. Moreover, "
survivors were rarely able to reach service providers before the crucial 72 -hour 
"window when post -rape kits, including HIV prevention treatments, are most effective, "
owing to the inability to secure transportation from remote areas  in a context of 
"limited infrastructure. Safe abortion care for survivors is not available, as terminating "
a pregnancy is only legally permitted if the mother’s health is at risk. There is also a 
lack of safe houses amid reports of survivors being deserted  by partners and relatives 
"in the wake of rape, resulting in socioeconomic marginalization and an increased "
number of suicides.   
 
 S/2023 /413 
 
21/35 23-08418  
   Recommendation  
 
60. I call upon the Government to expedite the implementation of the 2014 joint 
"communiqué, including by ado pting legislation on victim and witness protection, "
adopting national legislation in line with international obligations related to 
preventing and addressing sexual violence and expediting the implementation of the 
"action plan for the armed forces, includi ng by effectively vetting and removing from "
duty all members of the armed and security forces credibly suspected of committing 
or being responsible for crimes of conflict -related sexual violence. I urge the 
"Government to strengthen the delivery of multisec toral services to survivors, "
especially in areas affected by subnational violence and climate vulnerability.  
 
  The Sudan  
 
"61. The military takeover in October 2021 triggered a multifaceted political, "
"security and economic crisis marked by protests which, though largely peaceful, were "
"met with disproportionate force, including rape. Intercommunal violence persisted in "
"the Darfur region, as well as in Blue Nile, Southern and Western Kordofan States, "
"triggering the displacement of at least 265,273 civi lians. Against this backdrop, some "
key Sudanese military and civilian stakeholders signed a political framework 
agreement in December calling for an end to impunity for all forms of violence 
"against women, including sexual violence. Nonetheless, recent cla shes between the "
"Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces are deeply concerning. In 2022, "
"the United Nations documented 96 cases of conflict -related sexual violence, including "
"abductions, attempted rape and gang rape, affecting 63 women and 33 gi rls. The "
majority of victims were displaced women and girls who were often attacked while 
leaving camps in order to attend school or engage in essential livelihood activities. 
The perpetrators included armed nomads and other unknown armed men. The 
Sudanese  Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces were also implicated. In Darfur 
"and the Two Areas, documented incidents of sexual violence were perpetrated amid "
widespread insecurity. The Panel of Experts on the Sudan recorded 41 cases of sexual 
"violence and tw o cases of abduction against women and girls, in a context of "
underreporting owing to high levels of stigmatization and impunity ( S/2023/93 ). 
"Access to services is challengin g across the country, with the clinical management of "
"rape, legal assistance and psychosocial support  available in only 39 per cent of "
"localities. In Blue Nile State, amid three waves of violence, which erupted between "
"members of the Hausa community and me mbers of the Funj, Hamaj and Berta "
"communities in July, September and October, sexual violence was allegedly "
perpetrated against dozens of women and girls who were unable to access timely 
medical treatment.  
62. Numerous allegations of sexual violence arose  in the context of protests against 
"the military takeover. In 2022, the United Nations documented attacks, including gang "
"rape, rape and attempted rape, against 24 victims, including women, men and boys, "
"during or after protests. The police, including the Central Reserve Police, were "
implicated in six incidents; the others were attributed to members of other security 
"forces (Sudanese Police Force, Sudanese Armed Forces, Rapid Support Forces and "
"General Intelligence Service). In two incidents, protesters see king refuge from a "
violent crowd dispersal by the security forces were pursued and sexually assaulted. 
Incidents of sexual violence took place during interrogation by the joint security 
"forces, as well as in detention settings. Owing to the fear of reprisa ls and a lack of "
"trust in the justice system, only eight of the victims lodged official complaints. The "
"authorities established a committee, headed by a public prosecutor, to investigate "
human rights violations committed since the military takeover. Four a llegations of 
"rape are currently under investigation, and one has been filed in court. Most victims "
"received medical care, though five were unable to access timely assistance. In one "
S/2023/413   
 
23-08418  22/35 
" case, hospital staff refused to treat a victim of sexual violence without  a standardized "
"medical form serving as evidence of the assault, even though this form is no longer a "
prerequisite for post -rape care.  
"63. In 2022, the United Nations provided training on preventing and responding to "
"conflict -related sexual violence to over 1,000 police officers, prosecutors and "
"community members, of whom more than 700 were women, and supported the "
onboarding of 50 women to t he Sudanese Police Force in Central Darfur and another 
50 women into the Police Force in North Darfur. The United Nations supported the 
work of women’s protection networks in 21 displacement camps to facilitate referrals 
for services to address gender -base d violence. The United Nations continued to 
"support the implementation of the national plan for the protection of civilians, "
including by training personnel affiliated with the yet to be deployed Joint Security -
Keeping Force on the protection of women and the prevention of conflict -related 
sexual violence.   
 
  Recommendation  
 
64. I call upon the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces to commit 
"to a zero -tolerance policy for crimes of sexual violence, in line with their respective "
obligations und er international humanitarian and human rights law. I further call upon 
the authorities to accelerate the implementation of the Juba Agreement for Peace in 
"the Sudan, particularly the security arrangements, with a view to fostering a protective "
"environment , and to ensure that amnesty is not granted for conflict -related sexual "
violence. I urge the authorities to revitalize the implementation of the framework of 
"cooperation signed with my Special Representative, to publicly articulate a zero -"
"tolerance policy for sexual violence, to thoroughly investigate such crimes, including "
"those committed during protests, and to ensure the delivery of multisectoral services "
"to survivors, including in remote and rural areas.  "
 
  Syrian Arab Republic  
 
"65. As a result of 12 ye ars of protracted conflict, some 14 million people have been "
"displaced, and nearly 15.3 million people will require humanitarian assistance in 2023. "
"The volatile security situation, marked by ongoing insecurity predominantly in the "
"northern Syrian Arab Rep ublic, combined with economic hardship, have exposed "
"women and girls to risks of sexual violence, especially in displacement and detention "
settings. United Nations partners reported cases of sexual harassment by members of 
"the security forces against girls  at checkpoints, and instances of arbitrary arrest and "
sexual violence by armed actors against individuals with diverse sexual orientations 
"and gender identities. Moreover, young boys were reportedly exposed to sexual "
violence in detention owing to their a ctual or perceived affiliation with armed groups. 
Cases of sexual violence perpetrated by Da’esh against Yazidi girls abducted in Iraq 
in 2014 continued to be reported. The Independent International Commission of 
Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic collect ed information on patterns of arbitrary 
"detention, torture, sexual violence and enforced disappearances by Government and "
"pro-Government forces. In 2022, the Commission released reports that documented a "
systematic practice of detention to stifle political  dissent in the north -west of the 
"country, perpetrated by the Security Council -listed terrorist group, Hay’at Tahrir al -"
"Sham, with former detainees reporting torture and sexual violence ( A/HRC/49/77 ). "
"Moreover, in northern Syrian Arab Republic, the Commission reported instances of "
"torture and cruel treatment, including sexual violence, committed by the so -called "
"Syrian National Army in makeshift detention facilities, with one  woman describing "
"being subjected to rape and other forms of sexual violence in 2018, during "
interrogations ( A/HRC/51/45 ).  
 S/2023 /413 
 
23/35 23-08418  
 66. Conflict -related sexual violence remained sev erely underreported owing to a 
"lack of access by human rights monitoring groups to all parts of the country, the fear "
"of reprisals and stigma suffered by survivors. The situation at Hawl camp, in which "
"some 56,000 people remain, 94 per cent of whom are wom en and children, continued "
"to deteriorate. In November, the bodies of two girls, who were reportedly killed a few "
"days after being abducted and raped, were found discarded in a sewerage ditch of the "
"camp ( S/20 22/956 ). Women and adolescent girls were exposed to sexual violence, in "
"some cases resulting in unwanted pregnancies, which they often opted to conceal so "
as to avoid being forced to marry the perpetrator. Access to justi ce remained limited 
"owing to mistrust in the judicial system, as well as its often prohibitive costs. Limited "
funding for gender -based violence programming has affected the functioning of 
"referral pathways and safe spaces across the country, as well as the  availability of "
trained health -care workers and post -rape treatment kits.  
 
  Recommendation  
 
"67. I reiterate my calls upon all parties to end sexual violence, including in detention "
"settings, to hold perpetrators accountable and to facilitate humanitaria n access "
throughout the country in order to ensure the provision of multisectoral services.  
 
  Ukraine  
 
"68. Following the full -scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation, attacks "
across the country resulted in massive civilian loss of life and widespread destruction 
"of infrastructure. The frontlines have shifted continuously, with humanitarian access "
often denied in areas that are or have been under the temporary control of the Russian 
Federation. The deteriorating humanitarian situation and mas s displacement 
"increased risks of sexual violence and trafficking, especially for women and girls who "
comprise the vast majority of the nearly 8 million refugees and 7 million internally 
"displaced persons. In 2022, the human rights monitoring mission in Uk raine "
documented 125 cases of conflict -related sexual violence committed since 
"24 February, against civilians and prisoners of war, affecting 80 men, 42 women and "
"3 girls. In most incidents involving adult male victims, sexual violence was used as a "
"method  of torture during their captivity by Russian armed forces , Russian -affiliated "
armed groups1  and Russian law enforcement authorities. Violations included 
"electrocutions, beatings and burns to the genital area, forced stripping and nudity, "
"forcibly conduct ing a sexual act against another person, unwanted touching, and "
"threats of sexual violence against victims and their relatives. Incidents of rape, "
"including gang rape, were documented against 10 women, 1 girl and 1 man. The "
Independent International Commis sion of Inquiry on Ukraine also investigated sexual 
"violence crimes, reporting that the victims of rape ranged between 4 and over 80 years "
"of age ( A/77/533 ) and that perpetrato rs raped women and girls in some cases, in front "
"of family members, while in others, husbands or partners were killed.  The human "
"rights monitoring mission in Ukraine referred to 24 reported cases of forced stripping, "
"nudity and threats of sexual violence w ere committed by Ukrainian armed forces,2 "
law enforcement personnel and civilians or members of territorial defence units in the 
months following the invasion.  
"69. On 3 May 2022, my Special Representative, on behalf of the United Nations "
"system, signed a framework of cooperation on the prevention and response to conflict -"
related sexual violence with the Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine for European and 
Euro -Atlantic Integration. The Government has since taken steps to strengthen 
"national legislation and po licies, including by updating the national action plan for "

" the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) , and establishing a "
comprehensive inter -agency  working group to address sexual violence focusing on 
"anti-trafficking measures, the provision of assistance to survivors, access to justice, "
reparations and strengthening the security sector.  In order to enhance investigative 
"capacity with respect to sexu al violence crimes, the Office of the Prosecutor General "
"has established a specialized unit and deployed mobile groups, including police "
"officers, investigators, prosecutors and psychologists, to areas that have been under "
the temporary military control of  the Russian Federation. Some 200 prosecutors are 
"investigating sexual violence crimes, with national security and anti -trafficking "
"bodies collecting evidence. In March 2022, following a referral by 43 States parties "
"to the Rome Statute, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court confirmed the "
"opening of an investigation into the situation in Ukraine, encompassing any past and "
"present allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide committed on "
the territory of  Ukraine by any person s ince 21 November 2013. On 14 November 
"2022, the General Assembly adopted resolution ES-11/5 in which it recognized that "
the Russian Federation must be held to account for  any violations of international law 
"in or against Ukraine, including its aggression in violation of the Charter of the United "
"Nations, as well as any violations of international humanitarian law and international "
"human rights law, and that it must bear th e legal consequences of all of its "
"internationally wrongful acts, including making reparation for the injury, including "
"any damage, caused by such acts. It recommended the creation by Member States, in "
"cooperation with Ukraine, of an international register  of damage.  "
"70. Attacks on hospitals and health clinics hindered the provision of medication, "
"including emergency contraceptives, and constrained access to services related to the "
"clinical management of rape. In order to enhance referral pathways and servi ces, the "
"Government, with the support of the United Nations, established five centres "
"providing services, an online platform focusing on specialized assistance and a "
"national toll -free hotline for survivors of gender -based violence, and raised awareness "
"of ways to obtain access to services. With United Nations support, hospitals in 21 "
"provinces were equipped with post -rape kits, while safe spaces for women and girls "
"were established, including for internally displaced persons and returnees, in areas "
close t o the front line.  
 
  Recommendation  
 
71. I commend the Government of Ukraine on the adoption of a framework of 
cooperation with the United Nations to address conflict -related sexual violence and 
"encourage its full implementation, including through support from the international "
"donor and diplomat ic community, which I urge to allocate adequate and sustained "
"resources to this end. I urge all parties to immediately cease acts of sexual violence, "
and call upon the Russian Federation to make and implement specific time -bound 
"commitments to combat sexua l violence, which should include, inter alia: the "
issuance of clear orders through chains of command; the development of codes of 
conduct prohibiting sexual violence; the establishment of related enforcement 
procedures to ensure accountability for breachin g these orders; commitments by 
"individual commanders; the investigation of all credible allegations, including on the "
basis of information reported by relevant United Nations entities; accountability for 
those responsible; and unimpeded access for monitori ng and the provision of services 
and humanitarian assistance in areas under its control in line with Security Council 
"resolutions 1960 (2010) , 2106 (2013)  and 2467 (2019) . I commend the authorities in "
countries in the region for hosting refugees and call upon them to ensure quality 
"multisectoral assistance to survivors, and to adopt measures to mitigate the risk of "
conflict -driven trafficking.

   Yemen  
 
72. The humanitarian crisis and breakdown of the rule of law in Yemen hav e 
exposed women and girls to heightened risks of conflict -related sexual violence. 
"Following a United Nations -brokered truce, which was in effect between April and "
"October, there has not been a return to full -scale conflict, though reports of sporadic "
frontline hostilities persist.  
"73. Between April and June 2022, the United Nations recorded allegations of the "
killing of at least 19 civilians and 20 incidents of conflict -related violence. Sexual 
"violence, however, remains dramatically underreported owing to  entrenched harmful "
"social norms, stigma and the fear of reprisals. The United Nations continued to "
"document patterns of sexual violence in detention settings, including the case of a "
woman subjected to sexual violence while held for over a year in a priso n controlled 
by the Houthis  (who call themselves Ansar Allah).  Experts mandated by the Human 
Rights Council continued to express concerns over the systematic violation of the 
"rights of women and girls in areas controlled by the Houthis, reflected in the ma hram, "
which requires women to travel with a male family member or “guardian”. Movement 
restrictions have also been imposed on female Yemeni staff of humanitarian 
"organizations, which hindered the provision of humanitarian aid. Programming to "
prevent and ad dress gender -based violence is subjected to particular scrutiny in 
"Houthi -controlled areas, in which the use of terminology related to gender or rape is "
"discouraged, thereby undermining accountability. Access to sexual and reproductive "
health care has also  been severely limited by the Houthis. Health centres have been 
"instructed to only provide contraceptives to women in the presence of, and with the "
"consent of, their husbands, ostensibly to preserve Islamic “religious identity”.  "
 
  Recommendation  
 
74. I urge all parties to protect civilians in line with their obligations under 
"international humanitarian law, including by integrating provisions on the prevention "
"and response to conflict -related sexual violence in any future truce, ceasefire and "
"peace agreeme nt, and ensuring the full and meaningful participation of women in "
these processes. I reiterate my calls to ensure safe and unhindered humanitarian 
"access throughout the country, in order to make specialized services to address "
"gender -based violence availa ble, and to provide the United Nations with unrestricted "
access to detention facilities.

"conflict -related sexual violence remained uneven. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, "
reparations for survivors remain insufficient and inadequate. The Government is yet 
to implement a 2019 decision of the Committee against Torture ( CAT/C/67/D/854/2017 ) 
"requiring the State to ensure that prompt, fair and adequate compensation and other "
forms of reparati on are provided to a survivor of conflict -related sexual violence. In 
"July 2022, in a positive development, the Brčko District adopted a law on civilian "
"victims of war, drawing on the Model Legislative Provisions and Guidance on the "
"Investigation and Prose cution of Conflict -Related Sexual Violence, which recognized "
"a wide  range of victims, including children born of conflict -related rape. In April 2022, "
"in Kosovo,3  the authorities extended the mandate of the reparations commission, "
enabling it to continue verifying claims of conflict -related sexual violence until 2026.

" As of March 2023, 1,450 survivors had received reparations in the form of a monthly "
"stipend, as a result of the work of the commission.  "
"76. In Nepal, 17 years after the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, in "
"2006, survivors of conflict -related sexual violence continue to face challenges in "
"gaining access to services, justice and reparations. The second phase of the national "
"action plan on women and peace and security, adopted by the Cabinet of Ministers in "
"September 2022, has integrated the priorities of survivors of sexual violence and "
"individuals born of conflict -related rape, including incr eased access to civil "
registration. In order to inform the forthcoming amendment to the Transitional Justice 
"Act, the Government initiated a consultation process in 2022 with civil society "
"organizations, including a dedicated, confidential session with sur vivors of sexual "
violence.  
"77. In Sri Lanka, following the withdrawal, in 2020, of the Government’s "
"co-sponsorship of Human Rights Council resolution 30/1 , with the inte ntion to pursue "
"a domestically  driven approach to reconciliation and accountability, there has been "
no substantive progress in the investigation of cases of conflict -related sexual 
"violence. In February 2022, a second interim report was submitted by the co mmission "
"of inquiry appointed by the former President in 2020, in which it outlined a new "
proposal to establish a truth and reconciliation commission to advance transitional 
justice efforts ( A/HRC/51/5 ).  
 
  Recommendation  
 
78. I call upon the authorities overseeing transitional justice processes to adopt 
comprehensive legal frameworks aligned with international norms and standards; to 
develop national reparation programmes wi th adequate funding to provide survivors 
"and their children, including children born of conflict -related rape, with compensation "
and redress; and to consult survivors and their civil society representatives in the 
"design and delivery of all transitional ju stice processes, in line with the survivor -"
centred approach.  
 
 
 V. Other situations of concern  
 
 
  Ethiopia  
 
"79. After two years of fighting, formal peace talks mediated by the African Union "
led to the signing on 2 November 2022 of an Agreement for Lasti ng Peace through a 
Permanent Cessation of Hostilities by the Government of Ethiopia and the Tigray 
People’s Liberation Front. The agreement specifically called upon the parties to 
condemn any act of sexual and gender -based violence and included a commitmen t by 
the Government to implement a comprehensive transitional justice policy to advance 
"accountability, deliver redress for victims and support reconciliation. All parties, "
"including members of the Ethiopian National Defence Forces, the Eritrean Defence "
"Forces, the Amhara Special Forces and militia, and the Tigrayan forces, were "
reportedly implicated in acts of conflict -related sexual violence. Such attacks were 
"perpetrated in the context of the conflict in the Tigray region, which expanded to "
neighbouring Amhara and Afar regions in July 2021. Sexual violence against women 
"and girls in Tigray, Amhara and Afar reportedly included abductions, sexual slavery "
and other forms of sexual violence in captivity. Internally displaced and refugee 
women and girls were a t particular risk of trafficking for the purposes of sexual 
exploitation by armed forces and groups. National and international investigative 
"reports issued in 2022 focused on the Afar and Amhara regions, documenting "
incidents of conflict -related sexual vi olence by the parties since the beginning of 
hostilities in 2020. The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission and the Inter -Ministerial  
 S/2023 /413 
 
27/35 23-08418  
" Task Force, which was established by the Government to follow up on the "
recommendations of the joint investigation conducted b y the United Nations and the 
"Ethiopian Human Rights Commission ( S/2022/272 ), concluded that Tigrayan forces "
had perpetrated widespread and systematic sexual and gender -based  violence in these 
"regions. Regarding the Tigray and Amhara regions, the International Commission of "
"Human Rights Experts on Ethiopia, in their report  concluded that there are reasonable "
"grounds to believe that the Ethiopian National Defence Forces, the Eritrean Defence "
Forces and Fano committed widespread acts of sexual violence against Tigrayan 
"women and girls and that the Tigrayan forces also committed acts of sexual violence, "
“albeit on a smaller scale” ( A/HRC/51/46 ).  
"80. In 2022, humanitarian access constraints and restrictions on communications, "
"particularly in the Tigray region, and the reported presence of armed forces and "
"groups in the vicinity of health facilities  in the northern regions, hindered access to "
reporting and services. Where specialized desks and courts were established for 
"women and children, these were not always functional owing to the destruction of "
"public infrastructure and the absence of personnel . Despite those challenges, the "
"United Nations documented cases of conflict -related sexual violence in Afar, Amhara, "
"Oromiya and Tigray regions, affecting 72 women and 5 girls. An additional 908 cases "
affecting 842 women and 66 girls were reported by servi ce providers. These cases 
included instances of rape committed in front of family members and the gang rape 
"of women and girls associated with fighters of parties to the conflict, internally "
"displaced persons, women in detention, older women, women with di sabilities, men "
"and boys, and Eritrean refugees. The United Nations also reported incidents that "
"occurred in Afar and Amhara regions between July and November 2021, allegedly "
perpetrated by members of the Tigrayan forces and the Oromo Liberation Army. 
"Acro ss Tigray, Amhara and Afar, nine safe houses and 13 one -stop centres were "
"established, providing temporary shelter for survivors. In January 2022, the "
Government issued a decree tasking the Ministry of Women and Social Affairs to 
support the establishment of centres providing specialized services for women and 
"children who are victims of violence. As of August 2022, the Military Court had "
"delivered 25 convictions, 13 of which concerned sexual violence. A further 16 cases "
relating to sexual violence are pend ing. A transitional justice mechanism is under 
"discussion, to which the authorities plan to refer additional cases.  "
 
  Recommendation  
 
81. I welcome the signing of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement and call upon 
the parties to fully implement its provisions on condemning sexual violence. I call 
upon the Government to implement the transitional justice policy outlined in the 
Agreement and  to deliver reparations and redress to survivors. I further urge the 
Government to strengthen prevention measures and scale up efforts to provide 
"services to survivors, including by granting unhindered humanitarian access and "
cooperating with my Special Re presentative.  
 
  Haiti  
 
82. Insecurity due to gang -related violence reached unprecedented levels in Haiti in 
"2022, as armed gangs sought to expand their influence and territorial control within "
"and beyond the capital, through the deliberate use of killing s, kidnappings and sexual "
violence. This strategy was reinforced by ready access to military -grade weapons and 
"ammunition trafficked from abroad, in addition to the support of alleged political and "
economic sponsors who use gangs to influence the electoral  process and national 
"politics ( S/2022/747 ). In July, the Security Council adopted resolution 2645 (2022)  "
"expressing concern over widespread gang violence, including sexual and gender -"
"based violence, and calling for the deployment of women’s protection advisers. "
S/2023/413   
 
23-08418  28/35 
" Furthermore, in October, the Council adopted resolution 2653 (2022) , establishing a "
sanctions committee and a Panel of Experts on Haiti to monitor the implementation 
of targeted measures. Sanctions were declared against Jimmy Cherizier (alias 
"“Barbeque”) for his direct involvement, as the leader of the alliance of gangs known "
"as the “G9 Family and Allies”, in acts including the rape of seven women during the "
"attack in November 2018 on the neighbourhood known as La Saline, in Port -au-Prince.  "
"83. A United Nations joint report, published in October 2022, found that sexual "
"violence perpetrated by gangs constituted a deliberate strategy to instil fear, subjugate "
local populations and expand areas of influence and control. As recounted by several 
"victims and eyewitnesses, the brutality with which gang members committed these "
acts points to a clear intention to punish those considered supportive of rival groups. 
"During clashes, gang members raped women and girls, often from impoverished and "
"marginalized  neighbourhoods, as well as, to a lesser extent, men, boys and lesbian, "
"gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex persons. In some instances, victims "
"were raped in front of their children, after having witnessed the execution of their "
husbands. Gangs  targeted women and girls entering neighbourhoods under the control 
of rival gangs to undertake livelihood activities or attend school. Many victims were 
"forced out of vehicles at gunpoint, robbed and subjected to collective rape in broad "
daylight. Testimo nies from victims and witnesses indicated that kidnapping victims 
were sometimes raped several times by multiple armed captors in abandoned houses 
"where they were held for weeks. Moreover, gang members have coerced young "
"women, girls and sometimes, men, in to becoming their “sexual partners”, in exchange "
"for food, water and “protection” from other potential abusers for the victims and their "
"families. In November 2022, in response to the joint report, the Prime Minister of "
Haiti sent an open letter to my Spec ial Representative and Head of the United Nations 
"Integrated Office in Haiti, committing his Government to address sexual violence and "
"identify remedial measures and solutions. Moreover, in an effort to fight one of the "
"main drivers of gang violence, in Au gust 2022, the Government of Haiti finalized a "
national action plan under the framework of the Road Map for Implementing the 
Caribbean Priority Actions on the Illicit Proliferation of Firearms and Ammunition 
"across the Caribbean in a Sustainable Manner by 2030, so as to address the illicit flow "
of arms and ammunition into the country.   
84. Logistical and resource constraints hamper the effectiveness of national rule of 
"law institutions to investigate and address sexual violence, with police officers often "
fearing reprisals by armed gangs. The lack of protection for victims and witnesses 
"dissuades formal complaints. Throughout 2021 and 2022, several health -care "
"facilities and hospitals, as well as medical personnel, were attacked or compelled to "
suspend their  activities owing to threats or violence from gangs. Women’s rights 
"organizations reported rapes, physical assault and threats aimed at their staff. "
"Checkpoints were erected by gangs to restrict movement, and changes in gang "
"leadership, along with shifting  alliances, have complicated access to certain "
neighbourhoods. While most functional clinics and hospitals in Port -au-Prince are 
"equipped with post -exposure prophylaxis kits to prevent HIV transmission, and "
"provide emergency contraception, victims are rare ly able to gain access to these "
"treatments within the crucial 72 -hour window after a sexual assault, owing to "
prevailing insecurity. Several victims indicated having been infected with HIV and/or 
becoming pregnant as a result of rape by gang members. Many victims experience 
"acute trauma, depression and suicidal ideation, but there are very few mental health "
"specialists in Haiti. Severe physical injuries from collective rapes have, in some cases, "
"required surgical interventions, which can only be conducted i n the capital by a "
limited number of doctors. Few shelters are available to provide survivors with safe 
housing or reintegration support.   
 
 S/2023 /413 
 
29/35 23-08418  
   Recommendation  
 
85. I urge the authorities to monitor and investigate sexual violence perpetrated by 
gangs with a view to ensuring accountability and redress. I call upon the authorities 
"to provide multisectoral assistance to all survivors of sexual violence, with the "
financial support of international partners.  
 
  Nigeria  
 
86. Conflict -related sexual violence continued to be a major protection concern for 
"women and girls in north -east Nigeria in a context of insecurity, civilian displacement, "
"entrenched gender inequality and limited access to justice. In 2022, the United "
Nations verified 73 cases of se xual violence against girls perpetrated by non -State 
"armed groups. In terms of ongoing judicial processes, the Team of Experts on the "
Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict co -sponsored trainings on addressing 
conflict -related sexual violence for the complex -case group of the Department of 
Public Prosecutions and the serious crimes response team within the Nigerian Armed 
"Forces. For the first time, prosecutors have charged members of Boko Haram with "
inflicting serious bodily harm as an act of terrorism  for alleged acts of sexual violence.  
"87. In February 2023, the National Human Rights Commission of Nigeria "
established a panel to investigate allegations of system atic and forced abortions by 
"the national armed forces, affecting thousands of women and gir ls, many of whom "
had been held captive and subjected to conflict -related sexual violence by members 
of Boko Haram. The objectives of the panel are to determine the responsibility of 
"individuals and institutions, identify damages and compensation, and refer  human "
"rights violations to the Attorney General of the Federation or State. In addition, the "
panel will make recommendations on integrating human rights principles and 
practices into military and counter -insurgency operations.  
 
  Recommendation  
 
88. I call upon the authorities to prioritize the effective prosecution of crimes of 
"sexual violence, including in counter -terrorism cases, and to fully investigate "
"allegations of forced abortions by the armed forces, with a view to delivering "
accountability and compensation.  
 
 
 VI. Recommendations  
 
 
89. The following recommendations focus on harnessing the preventive power of 
"the rule of law by increasing investment in prevention, accountability and institutional "
reform. They should be read in conjunction with those presented in my previous 
reports.  
90. I recommend that the Security Council:  
 (a) Call upon all parties to conflict to immediately cease all forms of 
conflict -related sexual violence in compliance with relevant Security Council 
resol utions and provide the United Nations with unhindered access to conflict 
areas and detention centres;  
 (b) Support the accelerated deployment of women’s protection advisers to 
peace operations and offices of United Nations resident and humanitarian 
"coordin ators in all relevant situations of concern, in line with Security Council "
resolution 2467 (2019) ; 
" (c) Include in mandate authorizations and renewals of peace operatio ns, "
"as well as in transition plans, dedicated operational provisions on gender -"
S/2023/413   
 
23-08418  30/35 
 responsive security and justice sector reform in order to prevent and respond to 
conflict -related sexual violence;  
 (d) Encourage all State and non -State parties to conflict to adopt time -
"bound commitments to prevent and address conflict -related sexual violence, and "
"monitor their compliance, including through the Informal Expert Group on "
Women and Peace and Security;  
 (e) Ensure adequate consultations with women -led organizations  to 
"capture the most pressing peace, security and protection concerns faced by "
"women and girls, and enhance measures to protect women briefers to the "
Security Council from reprisals;  
 (f) Give due consideration to dedicated thematic visits on conflict -related 
sexual violence to situations on the agenda of the Security Council and ensure 
that concerns relating to conflict -related sexual violence are raised during visits 
"to relevant contexts characterized by early warning indicators of sexual violence, "
"inclu ding contexts of rising militarization, unconstitutional changes of "
"government, terrorism, gender -based hate speech, technology -facilitated sexual "
"violence and online harassment, electoral violence, political instability, "
intercommunal tensions and mass di splacement;  
 (g) Ensure that sexual violence is systematically monitored and 
incorporated as a stand -alone designation criterion for targeted sanctions to 
"deter the commission of such violence by all parties, including mercenaries and "
private military and  security companies; ensure that sanctions committees have 
expertise on conflict -related sexual violence and that my Special Representative 
on Sexual Violence in Conflict continues to be invited to provide briefings and 
share relevant information; and cons ider applying sanctions to persistent 
perpetrators who have appeared in the list annexed to the present report for five 
or more years without taking remedial or corrective action;  
 (h) Consider referring to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal 
"Cour t situations in which crimes of sexual violence, as defined in its Statute, "
appear to have been committed;  
 (i) Give due consideration to examining the impact of climate -related 
security risks as factors which can exacerbate conflict and violations of 
"international humanitarian and human rights law, including conflict -related "
"sexual violence, and solicit further relevant information on the linkages between "
climate change and conflict -related sexual violence from the Office of my Special 
Representative and r elevant United Nations entities in order to deepen the 
evidence -base for action.  
91. I encourage Member States:  
 (a) To adopt a survivor -centred approach to preventing and addressing 
conflict -related sexual violence that seeks to empower survivors by prioritizing 
"their specific needs, perspectives and aspirations, and considers intersecting "
"inequalities based on sex, gender, ethnicity, religion, migratory status, disabilities, "
"age, political affiliation, sexual orientation and gender ident ity, as well as HIV "
"status, among other factors; to ensure that survivors’ rights are respected and "
that their capacity to make informed decisions and to influence prevention and 
response policies and measures is promoted;  
 (b) To strengthen accountability  by adopting legislation drawing on the 
Model Legislative Provisions and Guidance on the Investigation and Prosecution 
"of Conflict -Related Sexual Violence; enhancing protection, investigation and "
"prosecution, through the training of justice personnel; pros ecuting conflict -"
 S/2023 /413 
 
31/35 23-08418  
" related sexual violence through appropriate judicial mechanisms, regardless of "
"the rank or affiliation of the perpetrator; and promoting transformative, gender -"
responsive reparations;   
 (c) To foster a gender -responsive security sector thr ough the development 
"of effective oversight and accountability mechanisms, including the "
establishment of vetting and screening to prevent credibly suspected 
"perpetrators from being recruited, retained or promoted within the security "
"forces; build the capa city of the security sector to anticipate, detect and respond "
to instances of conflict -driven trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation; 
and consider establishing specialized units to address sexual violence;  
" (d) To design, fund and implement na tional and local action plans on "
"women and peace and security, as well as implement related regional action plans, "
"which include dedicated, budgeted operational provisions to address conflict -"
related sexual violence;  
 (e) To adopt national legislation regu lating the activities of private 
"military and security companies and investigate, prosecute and sanction "
"violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, including sexual "
violence; to adhere to the principles outlined in the “Montreux Documen t on 
pertinent international legal obligations and good practices for States related to 
"operations of private military and security companies during armed conflict”, "
including the use of superior or command responsibility for failing to prevent or 
put an e nd to crimes committed by subordinates;  
 (f) To adopt national legislation on arms and ammunition control and 
"implement the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit "
"Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, the Arms Trade "
Treaty and other relevant instruments.   
"92. I encourage all stakeholders, including Member States, donors and regional "
and intergovernmental organizations:  
 (a) To adopt a survivor -centred approach to preventing and addressing 
conflict -related sexual  violence and foster an enabling environment for survivors 
"to seek support, to provide accessible and quality multisectoral assistance, "
"including HIV prevention, sexual and reproductive care, access to emergency "
"contraception and safe and timely abortion c are, as well as psychosocial and legal "
"services, ensuring that all efforts are guided by the principles of security, "
confidentiality and informed consent;  
 (b) To implement the platform of recommendations pertaining to women 
and girls who become pregnant a s a result of sexual violence in conflict and 
"children born of such violence, as outlined in my special report ( S/2022/77 ); "
 (c) To mitigate the risks of sexual violence asso ciated with livelihood 
"activities, by building community resilience and ensuring that women and "
survivors of conflict -related sexual violence have safe access to employment and 
"socioeconomic reintegration, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals; "
"and to ensure women’s full and meaningful participation in humanitarian, "
"recovery, peace and development processes;  "
 (d) To ensure that expertise on prohibiting and addressing conflict -related 
"sexual violence informs the design and implementation of peace, ceasefire, "

limitations;  
" (e) To create an enabling environment for women active  in public life, "
"including women human rights defenders, journalists and peacebuilders and "
those working directly on conflict -related sexual violence; to protect politically 
"active women from any form of reprisals and ensure that risks, including those "
"stemming from digital platforms, are duly addressed and perpetrators "
prosecuted; and to establish protection measures and timely responses for 
"civilians at imminent risk of conflict -related sexual violence, including those in "
"detention, displacement or migrat ion settings;  "
" (f) To tackle the root causes of conflict -related sexual violence, including "
structural gender inequality and harmful social norms that lead to the 
"stigmatization of survivors, by promoting women’s meaningful participation and "
"leadership in political, security and rule of law institutions, as well as by "
"engaging with faith -based, traditional and community leaders to promote "
attitudinal and social change;   
 (g) To address chronic funding shortfalls by providing predictable 
financial support to  the conflict -related sexual violence multi -partner trust fund

Programming will advance thepursuit of truth and justice for victims and survivors, and accountability for crimescommitted in violation of international human rights and humanitarian law.Russia’s ongoing, full-scale brutal war against Ukraine, which began on February 24,2022, has inflicted grievous and catastrophic harm on civilians, inclusive of horrificCRSV crimes. Among the numerous atrocities taking place, it is imperative indocumenting CRSV crimes to preserve focus on the prioritization of the protectionand support of survivors of conflict-related sexual violence and other particularlyvulnerable groups, including children. Ukrainian civil society groups and women andLGBTQI+ leaders are on the frontline of documenting and addressing CRSV, butreport being sidelined from decision-making and funding, or receiving funding fornarrow purposes and on timelines that do not allow them to support survivors,operate sustainably, or plan strategically. In addition to sexual violence reported bywomen and girls and marginalized groups, the issue of male CRSV perpetratedagainst men and boys, is particularly prevalent (including in Russian operated[1][2][3]20/06/2024, 00:57Page 2 of 42"
"detention centers) and must be comprehensively addressed. Finally, staff areexperiencing serious impacts to their physical and mental health, including primaryand secondary trauma, and need innovative psychosocial support to be able torespond to CRSV.Attempts to document CRSV within traditional accountability and legal frameworksoften fall short of considering the safety, wellbeing, and wishes of the survivors,which should include efforts such as avoiding unnecessary or duplicative interviews,providing mental health and psychosocial services, and adequate follow-on andreferrals to support survivors and their service providers. Furthermore, when notapproached from a survivor-centered perspective, CRSV documentation efforts canhave harmful unintended consequences (e.g., pressuring and retraumatizingsurvivors, creating survivor hierarchies, and overshadowing the larger gender-basedviolence epidemic). Advancing survivor-centered approaches to justice andaccountability, empowering survivor-focused organizations and survivors’ groups toidentify ethical ways to publicly report on CRSV to inform accountability efforts iscrucial. Accordingly, competitive proposals will reflect best practices in thedocumentation of CRSV from resources such as the International Protocol on theDocumentation and Investigation of Sexual Violence in Conflict and the Murad Code,a global code of conduct with the key objective of respecting and supporting“survivors’ rights and ensuring that work with survivors to investigate, document, andrecord their experiences is safer, more ethical, and more effective in upholding theirhuman rights.”A competitive project will build on existing locally led, survivor-centereddocumentation initiatives to collect information credibly, ethically, and professionallyon CRSV in accordance with international human rights and international bestpractices. The project should strengthen survivor-centered approaches to CRSVdocumentation efforts and existing networks to expand space for diverse Ukrainiancivil society and survivors’ groups so that they may work together to develop anddrive local, national, and international CRSV justice agendas, defined and determinedby survivors. The project should also focus on supporting sustainable coalitions of20/06/2024, 00:57Page 3 of 42"

Application Review Information20/06/2024, 00:57Page 27 of 42"
"E.1 Proposal Review CriteriaThe DRL review panel will evaluate each application individually against the followingcriteria, listed below in order of importance, and not against competing applications.Please use the below criteria as a reference, but do not structure your applicationaccording to the sub-sections.Quality of Project IdeaApplications should be responsive to the program framework and policy objectivesidentified in the NOFO, appropriate in the country/regional context, and shouldexhibit originality, substance, precision, and relevance to DRL’s mission of promotinghuman rights and democracy. Projects should have the potential to have animmediate impact leading to long-term, sustainable reforms. DRL prefers newapproaches that do not duplicate efforts by other entities. This does not excludefrom consideration projects that improve upon or expand existing successfulprojects in a new and complementary way. In countries where similar activities arealready taking place, an explanation should be provided as to how new activities willnot duplicate or merely add to existing activities and how these efforts will becoordinated. Proposals that promote creative approaches to recognized ongoingchallenges are highly encouraged. DRL prioritizes project proposals with inclusiveapproaches for advancing these rights.Project Planning/Ability to Achieve ObjectivesA strong application will include a clear articulation of how the proposed projectactivities contribute to the overall project objectives, and each activity will be clearlydeveloped and detailed. A comprehensive monthly work plan should demonstratesubstantive undertakings and the logistical capacity of the organization. Objectivesshould be ambitious yet measurable, results-focused and achievable in a reasonabletimeframe. A complete application must include a Logic Model to demonstrate howthe project activities will have an impact on its proposed objectives. The Logic Model20/06/2024, 00:57Page 28 of 42"
"should match the objectives, outcomes, key activities, and outputs described in thenarrative. Applications should address how the project will engage relevantstakeholders and should identify local partners as appropriate.If local partners have been identified, DRL strongly encourages applicants to submitletters of support from proposed in-country partners. Additionally, applicants shoulddescribe the division of labor among the direct applicant and any local partners. Ifapplicable, applications should identify target geographic areas for activities, targetparticipant groups or selection criteria for participants, and the specific roles of sub-awardees, among other pertinent details.DRL recognizes that all programs have some level of risk due to internal/externalvariables that have the potential to adversely affect a program. Risk managementshould address how the project design incorporates the identification, assessment,and management of key risk factors. DRL will review the Risk Analysis based on theorganization’s ability to identify risks that could have an impact on the overallprogram as well as how the organization will manage these risks.Institution’s Record and CapacityDRL will consider the past performance of prior recipients and the demonstratedpotential of new applicants. Applications should demonstrate an institutional recordof successful democracy and human rights programs, including responsible fiscalmanagement and full compliance with all reporting requirements for past grants.Proposed personnel and institutional resources should be adequate and appropriateto achieve the project’s objectives. Projects should have potential for continuedfunding beyond DRL resources.Addressing Barriers to Equal ParticipationDRL strives to ensure its projects advance the rights and uphold the dignity of allpersons. As the U.S. government’s lead bureau dedicated to promoting democraticgovernance, DRL requests a programming approach dedicated to strengthening20/06/2024, 00:57Page 29 of 42"
"inclusive societies as a necessary pillar of strong democracies.  Discrimination, violence, inequity, and inequality targeting any members of societyundermines collective security and threatens democracy. DRL prioritizes inclusiveand integrated program models that assess and address the barriers to access forindividuals and groups based on their race, ethnicity, religion, income, geography,gender identity, sexual orientation, or disability. The proposal should alsodemonstrate how the project will further engagement in underserved communitiesand with individuals from underserved communities. Applicants should describe howprogramming will impact all of its beneficiaries, including support for underservedand underrepresented communities.  This approach should be an integral part ofboth the concept and explicit design, and implementation of all proposed projectactivities, objectives, and monitoring. Strong proposals will provide specific analysis,measures, and corresponding targets as appropriate.  Stakeholders shall identify thedifference between opportunities and barriers to access, and design projectsaccordingly to not perpetuate these inequalities, but rather enhance programmaticimpact by including all people in society. The goal of this approach is to bringcommunities and those in power together in support of more stable and securesocieties.Cost Effectiveness DRL strongly encourages applicants to clearly demonstrate project cost-effectiveness in their application, including examples of leveraging institutional andother resources. However, cost-sharing or other examples of leveraging otherresources are not required. Inclusion of cost-sharing in the budget does not result inadditional points awarded during the review process. Budgets should have lowand/or reasonable overhead and administration costs, and applicants should provideclear explanations and justifications for these costs in relation to the work involved.All budget items should be clearly explained and justified to demonstrate necessity,appropriateness, and connection to the project objectives.Please note: If cost share is included in the budget, the recipient must maintain written20/06/2024, 00:57Page 30 of 42"
"records to support all allowable costs that are claimed as its contribution to cost share, aswell as costs to be paid by the Federal government. Such records are subject to audit. Inthe event the recipient does not meet the minimum amount of cost-sharing as stipulatedin the recipient’s budget, DRL’s contribution may be reduced in proportion to therecipient’s contribution.Multiplier Effect/SustainabilityApplications should clearly delineate how elements of the project will have amultiplier effect and be sustainable beyond the life of the grant. A good multipliereffect will have an impact beyond the direct beneficiaries of the grant (e.g.participants trained under a grant go on to train other people; workshop participantsuse skills from a workshop to enhance a national level election that affects the entirepopulace). A strong sustainability plan may include demonstrating continuing impactbeyond the life of a project or garnering other donor support after DRL fundingceases. Project Monitoring and EvaluationComplete applications will include a detailed M&E Narrative, which detail how theproject’s progress will be monitored and evaluated. Incorporating well-designedmonitoring and evaluation processes into a project is an efficient method fordocumenting the change (intended and unintended) that a project seeks.Applications should demonstrate the capacity to provide objectives with measurableoutputs and outcomes.The quality of the M&E sections will be judged on the narrative explaining how bothmonitoring and evaluation will be carried out and who will be responsible for thoserelated activities. The M&E Narrative should explain how evaluation(s), internal orexternal, will be incorporated into the project implementation plan or how theproject will be systematically assessed in the absence of one. Please see the sectionon Monitoring and Evaluation Narrative in the Proposal Submission Instructions (PSI)for more information on what is required in the narrative.20/06/2024, 00:57Page 31 of 42"
"Note: Applicants are no longer required to submit a detailed Monitoring andEvaluation Plan in their proposals. However, applicants should be aware that, shouldan application move forward for funding consideration, DRL will request a detailedMonitoring and Evaluation Plan for further review and approval.The output and outcome-based performance indicators should not only beseparated by project objectives but also should match the objectives, outcomes, andoutputs detailed in the Logic Model and Proposal Narrative. Performance indicatorsshould be clearly defined (i.e., explained how the indicators will be measured andreported) either within the table or with a separate Performance Indicator ReferenceSheet (PIRS). For each performance indicator, the table should also include baselinesand quarterly and cumulative targets, data collection tools, data sources, types ofdata disaggregation, and frequency of monitoring and evaluation. There should alsobe metrics to capture how project activities target those who face discrimination dueto their religion, gender, disabilities, ethnicity or sexual orientation and genderidentity, where applicable. Please see the section on Monitoring and Evaluation Plan inthe Proposal Submission Instructions (PSI) for more information on what is requiredin the plan.E.2 Review and Selection ProcessDRL strives to ensure that each application receives a balanced evaluation by a DRLreview panel. AQM will determine technical eligibility for all applications. Alltechnically eligible applications for a given NOFO are reviewed against the sameseven criteria, which include quality of project idea, project planning/ability to achieveobjectives, institutional record and capacity, inclusive programming, costeffectiveness, multiplier effect/sustainability, and project monitoring and evaluation.Additionally, the DRL review panel will evaluate how the application addresses theNOFO request, U.S. foreign policy goals, and the priority needs of DRL overall.

UKRAINE RESPONSE: 
GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE
6 MAY 2022 - 14 JUNE 2022
Gender Based Violence (GBV) is more prevalent in humanitarian crises where vulnerabilities and risks are heightened 
"and the family, community and social protection networks are fractured, weakened or overstretched. While sexual "
"violence is a major concern during conflict, as it is sometimes used as a weapon of war, other forms of gender-"
based violence also increase during crisis and displacement - for instance sexual exploitation is common along 
"migration routes. Vulnerabilities during movement, the lack of secure living conditions and the lack of stable "
community structures can also elevate the risk of GBV. Changes in family dynamics and loss of livelihood can lead to 
"further entrenchment of harmful gender norms and practices, such as early marriage, or increase intimate partner "
"violence. Women and girls, in particular, may become more vulnerable as a result of the lack of physical security, "
"poor infrastructure, design and overcrowding of displacement sites as well as lack of access to services. In addition, "
the increased presence of armed forces and the often large influx of crisis response staff can lead to heightened risk 
of sexual exploitation or abuse (SEA) by service providers.
IOM’s efforts to combat gender-based violence include both GBV specialized response and GBV risk mitigation 
"measures, including but not limited to: training of all staff involved in the humanitarian response on safe and ethical "
referrals of survivors and on the prevention of SEA; specialized services include provision of case management and 
"psychosocial support aimed to contribute to the survivors’ safety, healing, recovery and psychosocial well-being "
"and resilience; establishment and management of women and girls friendly spaces, training and referrals to other "
specialized actors such as health and legal practitioners;  capacity  building of other service providers on survivor-
centred approach and  meeting the individual needs of GBV survivors; and engagement with communities on 
services available for GBV survivors.
UKRAINE RESPONSE: GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE (6 MAY - 14 JUNE) OVERVIEW
1. DIRECT ASSISTANCE
"To ensure needs are addressed and people have access to timely and quality care, IOM offers comprehensive "
"direct assistance packages to survivors of GBV, in collaboration with our partners. During the reporting period, the "
following assistance was provided by IOM Country Offices:
IOM Greece: IOM supports Ukrainians arriving in 
Greece and residing in open accommodation facilities 
by providing targeted protection assistance to help 
"them meet most urgent needs (i.e. access to medication, "
"medical appointments, transportation to hospitals etc.). "
IOM also supports accompaniment and interpretation 
"to Ukrainians visiting hospitals, off-site services, "
"authorities etc., and conducts awareness-raising "
"activities on women’s rights, as well as the hotlines and "
emergency numbers available in Greece. 
IOM Moldova: IOM worked with seven NGOs to 
develop sub-grant projects to conduct outreach on 
"GBV, trafficking in persons and services available to "
"survivors/victims, as well as to provide assistance to  survivors in 16 raions of Moldova and in the Transnistrian "
region. La Strada Moldova and the NGO Interaction 
will be supporting this effort in running information 
campaigns and hotlines for the prevention of trafficking 
and  counselling related to GBV.
IOM Poland:  IOM supports survivors of GBV to get 
"access to housing services, psychosocial services and "
protection assistance. 
IOM Romania:  IOM provides holistic direct assistance 
"to survivors of GBV, including accommodation, "
"protection, education/language classes, cash assistance, "
"medical and psychosocial support. In that sense, IOM "
Romania continues to work with existing partners with 
2. CONVENING & DIALOGUEexperience and capacity to provide case management 
and assistance to survivors of GBV.
"In addition, the ‘fast-track transfers’ – jointly developed "
by IOM and UNHCR together with the Governments 
of Romania and the Republic of Moldova – continue 
to be operational. The fast-track transfers provide 
"a safe, orderly and dignified way to travel from the "
"border with Moldova to Romania, reducing the risks of "
protection concerns arising from unregulated or private 
transport. Upon entering Romania the blue dots hubs 
implemented by UNICEF and UNHCR work to identify 
individuals at risk of various protection concerns 
including GBV and make appropriate referrals.
"UKRAINE RESPONSE: GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE (6 MAY - 14 JUNE)IOM works in partnership with governments, the United Nations system, international and non-governmental "
"organizations, the private sector and development partners to ensure that its interventions are complementary, and "
"support the work of  the GBV sector as a whole. As part of this approach, the following initiatives took place during "
the reporting period:
IOM Poland: IOM met with the NGO Feminoteka in 
May 2022 to discuss their capacities in assisting victims 
of domestic violence as part of an ongoing mapping of 
services available to survivors.
IOM Romania: IOM actively participates in the 
"national Protection Working Group, which mainstreams "
GBV in the humanitarian response. The Protection 
"Working Group has developed, and is circulating, GBV "
referral pathways specific to certain geographical areas 
in Romania. Through monitoring and evaluation visits 
"to reception centres and border crossing points, IOM "
Romania identified key recommendations to reduce the 
risk for GBV and human trafficking and strengthen child 
"protection related measures. These recommendations, "
"and other protection concerns, were with the Romanian "
government.  IOM Ukraine: On the occasion of the GBV Sub-Cluster 
"meeting on 5 May 2022, IOM met with Ms. Pramila "
"Patten, Special Representative of the Secretary-General "
on Sexual Violence in Conflict (SRSG). IOM shared 
recommendations for the Framework of Cooperation 
"on Conflict-related Sexual Violence, signed on 3 May "
"2022 with the government, particularly in the field of "
trafficking.IOM Ukraine:  IOM’s Medical Rehabilitation Centre 
"for Trafficking Survivors, based in Kyiv, has broadened "
its support to include survivors of GBV. Tailored 
medical and psychological assistance is provided by 
"psychologists, psychotherapists, gynaecologists. In-"
kind and cash assistance to survivors can be provided 
for up to 14 people at a time.

4. ADVOCACY & COMMUNICATIONS
Awareness-raising and advocacy are critical to amplify programming impacts and support national efforts to develop 
"survivor-centered approach and GBV risk mitigation measures. As part of this approach, the following initiatives "
were implemented by IOM during the reporting period:
UKRAINE RESPONSE: GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE (6 MAY - 14 JUNE)IOM Germany: IOM distributed the IOM GBV pocket 
guide in Ukrainian with government and civil society 
"partners and shared social media content, including "
"IOM videos on GBV prevention, in multiple languages.IOM Malta: IOM disseminated an online questionnaire "
"to relevant stakeholders in Malta, with the aim of "
mapping existing services that could be made available 
to Ukrainian nationals arriving in Malta (i.e. material 
"support, accommodation, legal, psychosocial support, "
etc.) to inform possible responses. Respondents 
provided information on assistance available for GBV 
"survivors, which will help facilitate referrals, as needed."
IOM Poland: IOM continues to advocate for the 
protection of Third Country Nationals (TCN) in 
"detention in Poland, including people with diverse "
"Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression, "
"and Sex Characteristics (SOGIESC), particularly those "
exposed to GBV risks. IOM works with civil society 
organizations and international organizations through 
the TCN Working Group.  
IOM Ukraine: IOM is a co-chair of the GBV Sub-Cluster 
"Outreach Working Group, which meets bi-weekly to "
coordinate the outreach and communications activities 
by humanitarian actors working on GBV.
5. TRAINING & CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT
"IOM aims to support governments, civil society organizations, international organizations, and the private sector to "
"address GBV. This includes support to strengthen policies and procedures to facilitate the identification, referral, and "
"protection and assistance of GBV survivors. To this end, IOM supported the following initiatives during the reporting "
period:
IOM Romania: Mobile teams provided counselling 
to 303 Ukrainian nationals with the aim of reducing 
"vulnerabilities to GBV, amongst other protection "
"concerns, by empowering beneficiaries with knowledge "
"of their rights, legal advice, medical support and "
"protection available. To date, 430 Ukrainians have been "
"counselled by the IOM team. Furthermore, from 6- 8 "
"June 2022, IOM Romania, in partnership with UNHCR, "
delivered protection training to 68 child protection 
workers from the Direcția Generală de Asistență Socială 
și Protecția Copilului (DGASCP) and 75 NGOs and 
volunteer workers in the counties of Vaslui and Lasi. This training encompassed GBV; counter trafficking; 
protection from sexual exploitation and abuse; 
"accountability to affected populations, and child "
protection.
IOM Ukraine: IOM conducted a GBV refresher training 
for 18 NGOs who are IOM’s implementing partners. 
"Thirty-two participants, including social workers and "
"psychologists, learned about programmatic responses "
"to prevent and mitigate GBV, the core concepts linked "
to GBV and how to work with GBV survivors. .The English version of the GBV pocket guide that IOM

6. Strategic objective: Achieve gender mainstreaming in all policies and measures  
 
6.1 Legislative changes   
"The process of gender mainstreaming has started since 2008, when the Parliament of Albania "
"adopted the Law “On Gender Equality in Society”. In implementation of  this law, an important legal "
"framework was adopted, and specifically for gender budgeting, in 2012, the Council of Ministers "
"adopted a Decision “On Gender Integration in the Medium -Term Budget Programme (PBA)”, a "
"decision aimed at integrating the principl es of gender budgeting in budgeting processes, with the "
"aim of easing or eliminating gender inequalities in various fields, which have been affected by public "
"policies. To mention then the Organic Budget Law in 2016, the introduction for the first time of the "
concept of gender responsive budgeting in the budget system of the Republic of Albania and in 2017 
"in the Law “On Finances in Local Self -Government”, which created real opportunities for effective "
gender -responsive budgeting in all phases of the local financial management cycle (annual and mid -
"term budget programming, monitoring and reporting, assessment and audit) by local government "
units.  
 
Gender Responsive Budgeting is one of the key reporting areas for both national and international 
commitments to  Gender Equality of the Albanian Government. When reporting on the achievements 
"in the implementation of Gender Equality and Gender Responsive Budgeting policies, in particular "
"in the National Council of Gender Equality, the Ministry of Health and Social P rotection has always "
emphasised the importance of linking the strategic planning process of gender budgeting with the 
process of budgeting as the only way towards an effective implementation of and international 
commitments of Government Gender Equality.  
 
The National Gender Equality Strategy 2021 -2030 includes Gender Responsive Budgeting as one of 
"its pillars and provides a very good example of Integrated Planning. On the other hand, Gender "
Responsive Budgeting has also been used as a tool for the proper c alculation of costs for the 
implementation of all objectives as well as the actual budgeting of costs in the specific budget 
programmes of the responsible institutions.  
 
Budgetary funds dedicated to support gender policies are expected to strengthen the ro le of women 
"in business, agriculture or professional education. At the same time, budget funds are foreseen for "
"housing single -parent families, victims of domestic violence, divorcees, heads of households, etc. In "
"addition, budget funds are expected to str engthen the role of women in the integration process, "
cultural life in the country and the development of science. The fight against domestic violence and 
the support of abused women is one of the main directions of the work of the institutions at the 
"cent ral and local level, which in a co -ordinated manner aim to support and guarantee the safety of "
"the victims. Victim support with counselling, housing, legal assistance, psychosocial assistance, or "
the strengthening of referral structures and mechanisms at t he local level are included in budget 
"planning and are the object of monitoring, without mentioning here also the support of donors, "
mainly UN organisations in Albania .

 7. Principaux défis  ; leçons à retirer  
 
 
 
Les points positifs que je soulignerai sont la formation et l’expérience des techniciens et techniciennes 
du domaine de politiques d’égalité du Gouvernement et les points négatifs sont la difficulté pour 
avancer dans nos sujets en relation aux résistances qui présentent quelques professionnels. Une façon 
de résoudre ce problème si s’est déjà essayé par le biais de la conscientisation et la formation et les 
professionnels ne changent pas la manière de procéder est en facilitant aux citoyennes des feuilles et 
des circuits de réclamations pour obtenir un registre des incidents et mauvaises pratiques et pouvoir 
travailler avec ces professionnels et reverser leur comportement.  
 
Depuis 3 ans le domaine de politiques d’égalité du Gouvernement de l’Andorre ouvre une con vocation 
pour donner des subventions aux entreprises et associations civiques qui élaborent et impulsent des 
projets d’égalité de genre et de prévention de la violence de genre.  
 
Concrètement cette année s’y ont présentée 10 et ont été octroyée une totale de 40.000 €. Les projets 
"sont  : mener des conférences ciblées à la population sur égalité de genre, mener une conférence sur "

 Armenia  
 
1. Strategic objective: Prevent and combat gender stereotypes and sexism  
 
1.1 Legislative changes  
One of the changes in the new Criminal Code of the Republic of Armenia (entered into force on 1 
"July 2022) is the definition of criminal responsibility for discrimination. In the former Criminal Code, "
violation of equality was described as a pecuniary crim e. The previous regulations focused on 
"violations, directly or indirectly, of the rights or freedoms of a person, depending on person’s gender, "
"race and other factors, which caused damage to the rights and legitimate interests of the person.  "
 
"Meanwhile, t he new Criminal Code considers as discrimination the manifestation of differential "
"treatment that infringes the rights or freedoms of a person, or by which a person is given advantages "
"without an objective basis or legitimate purpose, on the basis of sex, race, skin colour, ethnic or "
"social origin, genetic characteristics, language, religion, world view, political or other views, "
"belonging to a national minority, property status, birth, health status, disability, age or other "
circumstances of a personal or social nature. The crime is considered completed from the moment 
of the differentiated treatment.  
 
"Unlike the former Criminal Code, the new Criminal Code has added the circumstances that can be "
"the basis for discrimination. For example, if previously the d isability was mentioned, then - the health "
status was added in the new Criminal Code.  
 
"In addition, if previously it was about violating the rights or freedoms of a person, then in the new "
Criminal Code it is also about giving advantages to a person witho ut an objective basis or legal 
purpose.  
 
Article 226 of the former Criminal Code of the Republic of Armenia established responsibility for 
"inciting national, racial or religious enmity. With the new legal regulation, this crime has been "
"formulated in a new  way, it has become more enhanced and comprehensive. Paragraph 1 of Article "
"329 defines: Public speech aimed at inciting or promoting hatred, discrimination, intolerance or "
"enmity against a person or a group of persons on the basis of racial, national, eth nic or social origin, "
"religion, political or other views or other circumstances of a personal or social nature, as well as "
"distributing material or objects for this purpose (...).The new legal regulation, in addition to "
"previously defined national, racial or religious characteristics, also defines ethnic or social origin, "
"political or other views or other circumstances of a personal or social nature, which may cause "
"enmity, hatred, discrimination, intolerance. On the objective side, the act can be done in t he form "
of public speech or distribution of material or object for the specified purpose. This definition gives 
greater clarity and certainty to the crime under discussion and is more in line with the current 
challenges.  
 
1.2 Policy changes  
"The Republic of Armenia government adopted the Resolution ""On approving the 2019 -2023 strategy "
"and programme of measures for the implementation of gender policy in the Republic of Armenia"".  "
 
"The Resolution defines the priority directions of gender policy, the purpose of which is to create "
favourable conditions for the enjoyment of the rights and opportunities of women and men in all 
"spheres of public life, taking into account the international obligations assumed by the Republic of "
Armenia.  
 
"Ministry of Labour and Social affairs (MLSA), as the agency leading the gender agenda in the country, "
advocates that the empowerment of women have a positive impact on economic and social 
"development, enabling prosperity and social cohesion. In this contex t, various measures and "
22 
 programmes aimed at creating an enabling environment for women to play a more active role in the 
economy continues to be implemented both with the funding of the state budget and in co -
operation with international and national non -governmental organisations.  
 
The government continues to take measures to promote equal economic independence for women 
and men and to remove barriers to women’s labour market participation. Various state programmes 
"have been developed in all spheres of pu blic and political life, to ensure the involvement of women "
"in the decision -making process. In particular, vocational training programmes are being "
implemented and much importance is being given to increasing the opportunities of accessing 
labour market by  uncompetitive young mothers through professional training and mentoring 
"programmes of employers, in addition to developing and implementing childcare support "
"programmes and Women's Leadership in Small and Medium Enterprises. At the regional level, "
“Women' s Resource Centres” are established in the regions (province) aiming at strengthening the 
capacity of rural women.  
 
To promote equal economic independence for women and men and to remove barriers to women’s 
"labour market participation, the Accelerator Nat ional Platform for Women's Economic "
Empowerment was launched jointly with UNDP and the Ministry of Economy which aims at 
"promoting women's entrepreneurship, increasing the demand of women in the labour market by "
strengthening their competitive advantages. The programme is designed to empower women so 
that they can actively participate in entrepreneurship and contribute to economic recovery efforts.  
 
1.3 Institutional changes  
"The implementation of the gender policy is institutionalised at the national, provincial and "
"community levels. As a co -ordinating mechanism, the Council on Women’s Affairs of the Republic of "
Armenia is committed to ensure the equal participation of women a nd men in political and socio -
economic processes. The Council supports the introduction of mechanisms for the inclusion of 
"women's social and political resources in the democratisation process of the society, ensuring equal "
rights and equal opportunities f or women and men. The Council is headed by the Deputy Prime 
"Minister, and its objectives include: Fighting against violence, combating discrimination in all sectors "
"of public life, promoting women’s economic empowerment. The Council monitors the impact of "
"state policies on gender equality, women's empowerment in various spheres of public life, "
"opportunities for expansion, reduction of discrimination, and prevention of gender -based violence. "
The Council may establish temporary thematic groups to address indi vidual issues or pressing issues 
"in the area of equal rights and opportunities for women and men, with the recommendation and "
"participation of non -board experts, the business community, and representatives of international "
and non -governmental organisation s.  
 
1.4 Research and awareness raising  
The Gender Policy Implementation Strategy of Armenia for 2019 -2023 sets the government's 
priorities and way forward to mainstream gender across diverse sectors.  
 
The strategy defines 5 priorities: 1) Improving the National Mechanism for the Advancement of 
"Women, Ensuring Equal Participation of Women and Men in Governance, at the Decision -Making "
"Level, 2) Overcoming gender discrimination in the socio -economic sphere, expanding women's "
"economic opportunities, 3) E nhancing full and effective participation of women and men in "
"education and science, 4) Enhancing equal opportunities for women and men in the field of "
"healthcare, 5) Prevention of Gender Discrimination.  "
 
"To expand employment opportunities for people with disabilities, the Ministry of Labour and Social "
"Affairs implemented the project ""Providing partial salary compensation to the employer in case of "
"employment, financial assistance to the accompanying person with a disability"", which involved 33 "
"people, 16 o f whom were women. At the same time, according to the legislation in the field of "
23 
" employment, persons with disabilities have the right to be included in all state employment "
measures as a matter of priority.  
 
1.5 Other pertinent developments . 
"Article 7 of the draft Republic of Armenia Law ""On Ensuring Equality"" (hereinafter referred to as the "
"Draft law) stipulates, that anyone who has reason to believe that he has been discriminated against "
"has the right to apply to the court, the Human Rights Defender o r the appropriate administrative "
authority to restore his rights and to receive compensation for material and non -material damage.  
 
"According to Article 6 of the Republic of Armenia Law ""On Ensuring Equal Rights and Equal "
"Opportunities for Women and Men"", direct and indirect gender discrimination in all spheres of public "
life is prohibited. One of the forms of direct gender discrimination is different pay for the same or 
"equivalent work, any change in pay (increase or decrease) or deterioration of working c onditions "
based on gender.  
 
"The Law on Education of the Republic of Armenia states: ""The Republic of Armenia guarantees the "
"right to education regardless of nationality, race, gender, language, religion, political or other views, "
"social origin, property status or other circumstances. "" Besides, according to the Law of the Republic "
"of Armenia ""On Higher and Postgraduate Professional Education"", the State guarantees citizens of "
the Republic of Armenia the right to free higher and postgraduate professional education in state 
"higher educat ional institutions on a competitive basis. Therefore, based on the above, it can be "
stated that the Republic of Armenia excludes discrimination against women and girls protecting their 
right to education.  
 
Actions aimed at the prevention of discrimination  are carried out. The preventive measures are both 
"of general nature (awareness raising, legal reforms, advocacy, etc.), as well as targeted and specific "
"(enhanced employment opportunities for women, enhanced opportunities in education, reduction "
"of cases of sex -selective abortions, etc.). Preventive interventions are implemented both by the state "
in co -operation with non -governmental and international organisations.  
 
The Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs in co -operation with the Council of Europe condu cted a 
three -day online media training on gender equality and gender -based violence among media 
"representatives. Journalists, editors, publishing directors, social media, online and broadcast media, "
including regional representatives were selected as the t arget group. The following topics were 
discussed during the training: 1) Gender stereotypes and discrimination as factors promoting 
violence against women; 2) Media as a tool for social change; 2) Promoting gender equality and 
"Supporting victims of domesti c violence; 3) Coronavirus - violence against women, as well as the role "
of the media in raising public awareness.  
 
2. Strategic objective: Prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence  
 
2.1 Legislative changes  
"Article 197 of the new Criminal Code stipulates responsibility for forced marriage, divorce or having "
a child. The disposition of the first part of the mentioned article has the following content: Forcing a 
"person to marry or divorce or have a child by using violence, threat of violence, blackmail, "
"humiliation, threat to destroy, damage or take property, or using the financial or other dependence "
"of the person affected by the crime, or other means of coercion(...). The previous Criminal Code did "
not provide for a similar crime.  
 
The new Criminal Code defines the responsibility for violent acts of a sexual nature. According to 
"Article 198, paragraph 1: Intercourse or other acts of a sexual nature, including simulating sexual "
"intercourse or satisfying sexual needs, which were commit ted against the will of the victim of the "
"crime or by ignoring the latter’s will, by using violence against the victim or another person or by "
24 
 threatening to do so or by taking advantage of the helpless state of the victim shall be punished by 
"imprisonment  for a term of three to six years. Within this crime, the acts of rape, violent acts of a "
"sexual nature, as well as the crimes of lewd acts using one’s violent or helpless state, have been "
"combined, because as a manifestation of the objective aspect, the s imulation of sexual intercourse "
"or the satisfaction of sexual needs, which are characteristic of the crime of lewd acts, is also "
"provided, with the difference that in this case responsibility is defined for such actions without "
"defining an age range, and i n the case of minors and children, stricter responsibility is foreseen.  "
 
The new Criminal Code of the Republic of Armenia also established responsibility for performing an 
artificial termination of pregnancy (abortion) or sterilisation of a person without the latter's prior 
and informed and properly formulated consent.  
 
The st rictest liability is established if the act negligently caused the death of the person affected by 
the crime or led to their or their close relative’s suicide or their or caused another serious 
consequence.  
 
"By the same logic, liability has been establish ed for forcing abortion or sterilisation. This crime is new "
in the Criminal Code and provides for forcing a woman to artificially terminate her pregnancy 
"(abortion) or a person to undergo sterilisation by using violence, threat of doing so, blackmail or "
other means of coercion.  
 
"Article 188, paragraph 1 of the new Criminal Code defines: Human trafficking -recruitment, "
"transportation, transfer, harbouring, or receipt of persons, as well as human exploitation or putting "
"in or keeping under the situation of ex ploitation, by use of violence or threat of use thereof or other "
"forms of coercion, through abduction, deception  or abuse of trust, using one’s influence deriving "
"from the person’s post or service position or authorities, or the personal dependence or vuln erability "
"of situation of the victim of crime, or providing, promising or offering material or other profit with "
"the aim of obtaining agreement of the victim of crime with the person supervising the victim, or "
accepting a similar proposal from the person s upervising the victim to give such an agreement (...). 
Unlike the previous regulation that defined “(...) using violence not dangerous to life or health or 
"threatening to do so or other forms of coercion (...)”, the new Criminal Code defines “using violenc e, "
"or threats to do so or other forms of coercion”. According to the previous legal regulation, the "
"performance of the act ""using violence dangerous to life or health or threatening to use it"" was "
"intended as a descriptive quality of the crime, according t o Article 132, paragraph 2, clause 4. With "
"the new legal regulation, separate types of manifestation of violence or its threat were not "
"distinguished, as part 1 of the article generally mentions any violence or the threat of its use, which "
is a more compre hensive and less vulnerable regulation in terms of qualification.  
 
Domestic violence centres launched in all regions of the country which are co -funded by the state 
"budget continued to provide support services to beneficiaries, such as social -psychological  and legal "
"support. With the co -funds provided by the state budget, there have been 2 shelters for victims of "
domestic violence.  
 
"The support centres provide services to beneficiaries, such as social -psychological and legal "
"assistance (legal aid, hotline s ervices) and protection measures stipulated in the law, make a decision "
to transfer victims of violence within the family and persons under their care to the shelter upon 
"their consent and in cases and following the procedure specified in the law, assist t he victims of "
violence within the family in finding job and receiving social assistance from the state or relevant 
organisations.  
 
"In order to support the victims of domestic violence, a lump -sum financial assistance is being "
provided to the victims of dom estic violence (up to 150 thousand AMD annually from the state 
budget). Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs is in charge of  this process. The money is to be used 
for the following purpose:  
25 
  
"1) To meet the minimum needs,  "
"2) To compensate fully or partially for the costs of medical treatment and rehabilitation,  "
"3) To compensate for the rent for living space to provide temporary housing,  "
"4) To compensate for the costs of training courses for getting a job, except for courses stipulated "
in state employment regulation pr ogrammes prescribed in the Republic of Armenia Law on 
Employment for unemployed persons and those not competitive in labour market.  
 
Within the framework of the five -year Action Plan of the Government (2021 -2026) a number of 
"measures have been developed, w hich will continuously expand the assistance provided to women "
belonging to vulnerable groups. The Government's five -year plan also envisages the expansion and

also participated in a training on  Gender Issues and Possible Solutions for Climate Change Mitigation.  
 
"In addition, in 2022, The Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs within the framework of the events "
"dedicated to the 16th day against gender -based violence together with the ""Oxygen Found ation"" "
"and the ""UN Population Fund"" launched a campaign entitled ""Prominent Armenian Women for "
"Women's Empowerment"" with the aim of raising women's awareness on the importance of gender "
equality.  
 
"At the same time, the Ministry, together with the “Oxygen Foundation”, conducted training for "
"regional journalists entitled ""The Problem of Emphasizing the Role of Women in Public Perceptions "
in Armenia”.

"Besides, the staff of the Department of Public Relations and Information of the Police regularly "
participate in training and seminars organised by international and non -governmental organisations.  
 
"5. Strategic objective: Protect the rights of migrant, r efugee and asylum -seeking women and girls  "
 
5.1 Legislative changes  
"Provisions on granting refugee status are enshrined in the ""Refugees and Asylum"" Law of the "
Republic of Armenia.  
 
5.2 Policy changes  
A number of measures aimed at identifying human trafficking and related crimes are implemented 
"by the Police of Armenia. It is ensured by the decision No. 909 -L of June 4, 2020, and approved by "
"the government for 2020 -2022, within the framework of implemen tation of Armenia’s National "
Action Plan on Combating trafficking and exploitation.  
 
5.3 Institutional changes  
The Law of the Republic of Armenia “On refugees and asylum” regulates the relations pertaining to 
"grant of asylum and recognising as refugees  in the Republic of Armenia, as well as ensures "
"application of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, its 1967 Protocol and "
recognises the right of all foreigners and stateless persons to seek asylum in the territory of the 
"Republic of Arm enia and at crossing points of the state border of the Republic of Armenia, as well as "
to receive asylum.  
 
"Foreigners, including stateless persons, who entered the country illegally were not held criminally "
"liable provided that they applied for asylum immediately on arrival, in accordance with article 329 "
"(3) of the Armenian Criminal Code, which was in line wit h the Convention relating to the Status of "
"Refugees. Since 2018, 10 asylum applications had been received from persons who had entered the "
country illegally and applied for asylum.  
 
"Despite  its limited  financial  capacity,  Armenia  continues  to be a refugee  accepting  country,  providing  "
asylum  to people  affected  by war and internal  unrest  at various  times.  Armenia  has accepted  
refugees  from  Iraq and Syria  in different  years.  
 
"In November 2019, the Government had approved a programme to provide refugees from "
Azerbaijan who had entered Armenia between 1988 and 1992 with certificates enabling them to 
purchase apartments. The Migration Service had received 300 applications and had granted 240 
"certificates. Once the programme had been completed in the capital, it w ould be implemented "
throughout the country. Funding of 1.4 billion drams for the programme for 2020 –2024 had been 
approved. Increasing numbers of refugees from Azerbaijan were being granted Armenian 
"nationality, affording them greater protection. A budget of 13 million drams had been allocated to "
assist those refugees with their applications for Armenian nationality.  
 
As a result of the military aggression unleashed by Azerbaijan against Artsakh/ Nagorno Karabakh in 
"2020, more than 91.000 people were forced  to flee their homes and find refuge in Armenia, 88% of "
whom were women and children.  
 
A significant number of the arrivals from Nagorno Karabakh may not be able to return safely even 
"now with the ceasefire in place, particularly residents of territories c urrently under control of "
"Azerbaijan. Most of the displaced persons, particularly from Shushi and Hadrut region, became "
"refugees twice, as in the 1990s they were displaced from different cities of Azerbaijan, as well as the "
settlements of Artsakh under the  control of Azerbaijani forces and subjected to ethnic cleansing.  
 
32 
" The priorities of the Government have expanded to include the creation of economic, social "
and psychosocial support  mechanisms to provide for the mental and physical wellbeing of the 
"affect ed population, particularly vulnerable groups such as children, women, elderly, and people "
with disabilities.  
 
The priorities of the Government have been expanded to include the creation of psychosocial 
"support mechanisms to provide for the mental and phy sical wellbeing of the affected population, "
"particularly vulnerable groups, such as children, women, veterans of war and people with disabilities, "
as well as the implementation of comprehensive programmes aimed at meeting the needs of war 
"veterans, includi ng medical care, procurement of prostheses, and psychological support. "
"Accordingly, the beneficiaries were provided with psychological, social support services and financial "
assistance (based on the specific needs). A Centre was established to provide hous ing and other 
"essential services, to identify the needs of the displaced persons, to assess and to address those "
"needs. Furthermore, a Hotline Centre was established in order to receive urgent calls and help the "
"beneficiaries accordingly. In addition, dign ity kits containing essential hygiene items for women and "
new -borns were distributed to displaced women and girls. It’s important to note that a particular 
support was provided to pregnant women by ensuring the provision of safe access to healthcare 
servic es for mothers and new -borns.  
 
5.4 Research and awareness raising . 
"As mentioned, the National Strategy for Human Rights Protection and the Action Plan for 2020 - "
2022 deriving therefrom has been approved by Decision of the Government No 1978 -L of 26 
"December 2019. In this context, the Ministry of Justice of Armenia, which has carried out the co -"
"ordination of works of strategy development, drafts such documents as inclusively as possible, "
"namely in September 2019, three sectoral discussions were organised, within the scope of which, "
"inter alia , the priorities for the protection of rights of women were discussed, which were later "
included in the documents. Many non -governmental organisations engaged in the protection of the 
"rights of women, lawyers, representatives of the Supreme Judicial Counci l, deputies of the National "
"Assembly and others participated in those discussions. As a result, many important points relating to the "
rights of women have been included in the National Strategy for Human Rights Protection:  
-Criminalise domestic violence and violence against women in line with international standards;  
-Provide in legislation procedural safeguards relating to effective remedy for persons having 
"suffered from domestic violence and violence against women, in line with international standards;  "
- Conduct training on domestic violence and violence against women in line with international 
"standards, including for police officers, investigators, prosecutors, judges and medical workers, "
"representatives of educational institutions, employees of suppo rt centres for persons subjected to "
domestic violence;  
- Adopt an action plan to combat domestic violence;  
- Promote engagement of women in the armed forces.  
 
"NGOs also carried out awareness -raising activities. In 2017 -2018, in collaboration with “Women’s "
"Rights Centre” NGO, a series of programmes on “Shant” TV channel was implemented, with "
"repeated playbacks, which was aimed at rejecting tolerance for violence, stereotypes for "
justification.  
 
The standard and syllabus of the subject “Social studies” of 8th-12th grades of schools of general 
"education cover topical units relating to fundamental human rights, legal equality of women and "
"men, elimination of violence, tolerance and civil society. Topical gender materials are also included "
"in elementary grades, in the syllabus of the subject “Me and the Surrounding World”.  "
 
"During the instruction of the mentioned subjects, learners are informed of topics on legal equality "
of women and men in all spheres of life.  
 
  
33 
  
5.5 Other pertinent developments  
"In 2020, the European Union, in co -operation with the Government, launched a new Programme ""Local "
"Empowerment of Actors for Development (LEAD)"", in the development process of which the Migration "
Service of the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Infrastructu res had also participated. The 
"programme provided an opportunity for migrants, including returnees, as well as migrant workers and their "
family members to start small or medium -sized business  in their communities.  
 
The objective of the programme was to dir ect the economic and human potential of migrants to the 
"social -economic development of the country, to create a favourable environment for investing in "
"Armenia the financial resources accumulated in the migrant host country, to support migrant "
"workers and returnees to realise their entrepreneurial/business ideas, thus ensuring the effective "
and successful return of Armenian migrants to their homeland. The programme enabled the 
"migrants and their family members, using their financial resources accumulated in  the host country "
"and the equitable funding received from the donor organisation, to make an investment in Armenia "
to implement their own entrepreneurial and business plans.  
 
6. Strategic objective: Achieve gender mainstreaming in all policies and measur es 
 
6.1 Legislative changes   
"Article 83 of the ""Electoral Code"" (Constitutional Law) adopted on May 25, 2016, stipulates that The "
"number of representatives of each gender in the first part of the electoral list of the party, alliance "
"of parties and each of the parties included in the alliance, starting from the first number, in any "
"whole number of triplets (1 -3, 1-6, 1-9 and so on until the end of the list) must not exceed 70%.  "
 
The gender -sensitive component was ensured for all programmes included in the state budget from 
"2020. As a result, the content of the state budget reflected the goals of gender equality and social "
"justice, distributing resources, directing revenues in a way ensuring that the needs of all groups of "
the population are equally addressed.  
 
The gender component was included in the primary and secondary education capacity during the 
review of the state standard of general education and curricula; it was also included in the 
requirements for the development of illustrative materials on relevant topics in the published 
textbooks.  
 
6.2 Policy changes  
One of the principles included in the developing of the Draft Law of the Republic of Armenia “On 
Approval of the State Programme for the Development of Education of the Republic of Armenia until 
"2030” is the UN Agenda for Sustainable Development for 2030, in particular, SDG 4 (Ensure inclusive "
and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all) and 5 (Achieve 
gender equality and empower all women and girls.).  
 
"In the educational system of Armenia, since 2007, the ""Healthy L ifestyle"" course has been taught in "
"public schools, the content of which includes topics such as gender equality, domestic violence, "
"sexism and women's rights. From the 2017 -2018 academic year, within the framework of co -"
"operation with the UNESCO office in  Moscow, in order to increase the quality of the course, the "
"Armenian State Institute of Physical Culture introduced the course ""Methodological basics of "
"teaching a healthy lifestyle in public schools"" and developed a training manual for that course.  "
 
The materials posted on the www.teenslive.am website of healthy lifestyle for Armenian teenagers 
"and parents, created by the ""Arabkir"" Medical Complex Children and Adolescent Health Institute in "
"co-operation with the Moscow Office of UNESCO, were guaranteed to  be used as auxiliary teaching "
34 
" material for the ""Healthy Lifestyle"" course by the order N 1294 -A/2 of the Minister of Education of "
the Republic of Armenia dated 09.11.2017.  
 
"On the initiative of the United Nations Population Fund, an online version of the  ""Healthy Lifestyle"" "
school course on reproductive health has been developed. The version has been duly tested.  
 
"The online version of the ""Healthy Lifestyle"" school course on reproductive health topics developed "
by the United Nations Population Fund (http :unfpa.apps.am) was tested in 100 randomly selected 
"schools of Shirak, Armavir and Syunik marzes (regions) of Armenia.  "
 
"According to the new state standard of general education, from 2020, the new programme and "
"standard of ""Healthy lifestyle"" has been test ed, which was developed for grades 5 -11 and includes "
the above -mentioned topics with updated and in -depth content.  
 
"As mentioned in Part 1.2, the Council for Women's Affairs is established as a national mechanism "
that supports the introduction of mechanism s for the inclusion of women's social and political 
"resources in the democratisation process of society, ensuring equal rights and equal opportunities "
"for women and men. The purpose of the Council is to support the implementation of ""strategic"" "
"tactical pr ogrammes for the development of women's issues in the Republic of Armenia, issues "
"related to gender equality, gender discrimination and violence. Representatives from stakeholder "
"state bodies, non -governmental and international organisations can participat e in the activities of "
the Council.  
 
6.3 Institutional changes  
"As mentioned in Part 1.2, the Interagency Working Group operates with the purpose of organizing "
the ongoing activities of the Council for Women's Affairs.  
 
The Council may set up temporary thematic groups to address individual or pressing issues related 
to equal opportunities for women and men at the suggestion and participation of non -board 
"professionals, the business community, and representatives of international NGOs.  "
 
6.4 Research and awareness raising  
Female pedagogues are included in the lectures and courses in the field of cultural education and 
sport.  
"Women are also included in the marketing, segmentation, targeting, positioning, knowledge and "
resource building co urses organised for employees of state organisations operating in the field of

 Austr ia  
 
1. Strategic objective: Prevent and combat gender stereotypes and sexism  
 
1.1 Legislative changes . 
Please see last report.  
 
1.3 Institutional changes  
The Austrian Fund for the Empowerment of Women and Girls “LEA -Let`s empower Austria”  was 
founded in 2022 to create another strong instrument for promoting gender equality in Austria.  
 
"One of the primary topic areas, which the f und will devote itself to, is the promotion of women and "
"girls in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ( STEM ). The fund is committed to "
bringing about a change of thinking concerning stereotypical gender roles through STEM -projects as 
well as by co -ordinating existing STEM -initiatives. Increasing the number of women in the often -
well-paid STEM professions can contribute to the economic independence of women and to the 
closure of the gender pay gap.  
 
"LEA will offer a wide range of (empowerment)  activities  and initiatives, such as role model "
"campaigns, school workshops with female role models and webinars to promote the financial "
"literacy of women and girls. Co -operation with important stakeholders, such as the Technical "
"Museum in Vienna and Aust rian universities, will bring added value to LEA’s activities.  "
 
1.4 Research and awareness raising  
"In September 2021, the so called “integration ambassador” initiative (German: "
ZUSAMMEN:ÖSTERREICH ) celebrated its 10th anniversary and a new focus on self -determination 
"for women and girls has been set (“Geh deinen Weg!”). In addition, the empowerment podcast “Du "
bestimmst.Punkt.” for girls and young women was launched by the Austrian Integration Fund ( ÖIF) 
"together with a migrant’s magazine called “biber”. As part of the initiative, young migrant women "
from different communities report on their path to self -determination. See: 
https:// www.integrationsfonds.at/zielgruppen/frauen/  and below chapter 5.  
 
In order to advance the continuous gender -differentiated data collection and data evaluation in 
"Austria, the annually “ Gender Index”  is produced: It provides an overview of gender -disaggregated "
"data in key areas such as education, income, and employment and sheds light on gender relations "
from various perspectives. On the one hand by highlighting differences and similarities in the lif e of 
"women and men, on the other hand by making specific situations visible, such as single parents, "
retired women or women in management positions – overall: the different conditions women face 
compared to men.   
 
Particular efforts are applied in specifi c policy areas like migrant integration. The Austrian 
"Integration Act  foresees continuous data collection of gender -differentiated information, which "
allows crucial insight in gender related differences and discrimination. The data is further evaluated 
by the ‘Expert Council on Integration’ and the ‘Advisory Committee on Integration’ and is used as a 
basis for policymaking.  
 
The newly founded Austrian Fund for the Empowerment of Women and Girls “LEA -Let`s empower 
"Austria”  wants to reduce gender stereotypes,  for example by introducing and promoting role models "
from the most diverse areas of life and society (including STEM). The first role model 
"initiative/campaign with videos has already started. Together with some of the role models, LEA will "
also offer awa reness -raising work in educational institutions.  
 
36 
" Since October 2021, Austria is funding 14 projects that combat gender stereotypes in STEM fields , "
to promote more women in STEM related jobs and to raise financial literacy of women and girls. All 
projects will conclude in December 2022. An additional call for projects has been published in 2022: 
funding in the total amount of € 2 million will be offered for projects to promote women and girls in 
"STEM fields, to promote digital competencies of women and girl s and to combat cyber violence "
against women and girls (see 2.5)  
 
2. Strategic objective: Prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence  
 
2.1 Legislative changes  
"Austria has a long -standing history of policy making in the area of domestic violence, marked by the "
"Violence Protection Act  1997, which had its 25th anniversary  in spring 2022. It sent a clear signal "
that domestic violence is not considered to be a privat e matter by introducing the principle “the one 
"who hits, leaves”. Within the last years, important legislative improvements have been made – "
please see former reports.  
 
"Since July 1, 2022, courts have the option of ordering a perpetrator of violence to par ticipate in "
violence prevention counselling . The request requires that the court has issued an interim 
injunction in the proceedings on protection against violence at home (Section 382b Act of the 
Enforcement of Judgements) and general protection against v iolence (Section 382c Act of the 
Enforcement of Judgements) and that the defendant has not yet participated in violence prevention 
counselling under the Security Police Act . The defendant shall then contact a counselling centre 
within five days of the issu ance of an interim injunction to arrange counselling and shall actively 
participate in counselling on violence prevention. The counselling must take place for the first time 
within 14 days at the latest from the date of contact. For this victim -protection -oriented offender 
"work in individual or group therapy, counselling of up to 16 hours is provided.  "
 
A notable legislative change in connection with the specified requirements that took place in Austria 
relates to paragraph 13 WaffG  (Austrian weapons law ). A provisional weapons ban is now issued 
"automatically when a police officer, due to a case of domestic violence, imposes an entry and "
approach order.  
 
2.2 Policy changes  
"In autumn 2021, the Institute for Conflict Research (IKF) was commissioned to conduct a study "
entitled Investigation of Female Homicides 2010 - 2020  - a quantitative and qualitative Analysis  in 
"order to improve the data and knowledge base, to identify and analyse gender -specific differences "
"and motives, and to gain insights into additional prevention and intervention options. The first "
results of this comprehensive study were presented at the violence protection summit at the Federal 
Criminal Police Office on 23 November 2021. The study is expected to be completed by the end of 
2022. The study is to provide starting points for further measures in the field of law enforcement.  
 
"Especially in proceedings for domestic violence, the earliest possible and well -founded "
objectification of injuries is a key topic of evidence. Meaningful expert forensic medical reports can 
significantly increase the likelihood of a conviction. The shortage of forensic medical experts in 
"Austria prevails, therefore the expansion of outpatient clinics for victims of violence "
(„Gewaltambulanzen“)  is currently negotiated. Talks are ongoing between the relevant ministries 
which target the survey of the status quo in the field of clinical forensic examinations of victims of 
violence and the promotion of the establishment of round -the-clock outpatient clinics for victims of 
violence on the basis of Article 25 of the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and 
Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (“Istanbul Convention”).  
 
"Following a public tender in 2013, Violence Protection Centres  were established in each federal "
province and commissioned for an unlimited period of time. The “Violence Protection Package 
37 
" 2021”  led to an increase in funding up to 50% (see last report). In a utumn 2021, the respective "
"contracts were adjusted by additional counselling services , including:  "
 Co-operation with regards to security police case conferences and victim protection -
oriented perpetrator work;  
 Co-operation with the newly established Counselling Centres for Violence Prevention (for 
"further information, please see last report);  "
 counselling services covering the augmented aspect of cyber violence and  
" the pro -active aftercare (i.e., actively contacting victims after the counselling has b een "
completed to ensure the sustainable impact of the support)  
 
"On 29 September 2021, the Federal Ministry of Justice organised an exchange of experience  on the "
topic of “ violence in the social environment”  between representatives of the public prosecutor' s 
"offices, the courts, the Federal Criminal Police Office, the Ministry of Women's Affairs, victim "
"protection institutions, the probation support organisation NEUSTART and the lawyers’ organisation.  "
This exchange at the federal level is to take place annu ally in the future and serves to improve 
communication and networking between the institutions involved as well as to jointly develop best 
practices at the federal level and to discuss upcoming challenges and problem -based on completed 
cases.  
 
The policies that deal with domestic violence and violence in the public space are continuously 
adapted to respond to current developments in those areas of police activity. The guideline  for the 
"implementation of  Security Police Case Conferences , which wa s developed with the involvement "
"of representatives of NGOs, the security authorities, experts from some State Police Departments "
"and the Criminal Intelligence Service of Austria is now utilised by Austrian law enforcement. Further, "
the documentation relat ing to Security Police Case Conferences has been further formalised.  
 
"The e-learning tool , which was developed for the Protection against Violence Act 2019 and contains "
a module on Security Police Case Conferences is continued to be used in the standardise d training 
"of law enforcement personnel. In addition, three new training videos that deal with domestic "
violence have been developed and made available to all police officers by the Criminal Intelligence 
Service of Austria.  
 
2.3 Institutional changes  
"Continuation of the inter -ministerial working group  „Protection of Women against Violence“ , "
"comprising relevant ministries, all federal states and specific NGOs with its main task being the "
exchange of expertise and support of implementation measures.  
 
Continuation of the National Co -ordination Body  „Protection of Women against Violence“  with its 
main tasks being the national co -ordination of state reports under the Istanbul Convention and 
exchange with other national co -ordination bodies as well as analys is and dissemination of specific 
data.  
 
"Continuation of other relevant Working Groups esp. on Trafficking in Human Beings, Prostitution "
and Forced Marriage . 
 
Continuation of an ad -hoc working group with the aim to assure accommodation in women’s 
shelters o f high -risk victims  across Austria’s provinces under the lead of the Directorate General for 
Women and Equality.  
 
  
38 
 2.4 Research and awareness raising   
Another major point relating to research and awareness raising is the final report on the evolution 
"of the Protection against Violence Act 2019 . Once published, it shall give insights into the "
effectiveness of domestic violence policies in Austria and enable adjustments accordingly.  
 
Continuation of awareness -raising campaigns of the wide public on domes tic violence  
A media campaign was conducted as part of the international campaign “16 Days Against Violence” 
in November 2021. The aim of the campaign was to put the service of “Violence Protection Centres” 
on the map. The campaign was implemented in print  media as well as on info screens in public 
"transport, bus stops and stations.  "
 
"As a result of the Russian attack on Ukraine, the brochure “Violence against Women – Support "
"Organisations”  was updated, translated into Russian and Ukrainian and uploaded on t he website of "
the Directorate General for Women and Equality.  For more information please consult:  
https://www.bundeskanzleramt.gv.at/agenda/gewalt -gegen -frauen.html  
 
"Follow ing the success of the last two years, the 3rd Summit on the Protection of Violence against "
Women  will be held in November 2022. The Summit shall serve as a platform for exchange and 
discussion with the overarching goal of bringing together all relevant st akeholders. The Summit in 
year 2021 focused on the importance of clinical forensic medicine for violence prevention and 
protection.  
 
Research studies  
Austria will be among the first countries in the EU to finish the prevalence study “gender -based 
violence 2020/2021”  (“Gender based violence survey”) in autumn 2022. The Austrian report is 
currently being finalised.  
 
A qualitative and quantitative research study on all homicides against women of the past 10 years 
(2010 -2020)  was commissioned to acquire knowled ge of the circumstances under which murders 
were committed and accordingly to take targeted measures (see 2.2). First data was presented at 
the 2nd Violence Protection Summit in November 2021 (see information above). The final results are 
expected end of t he year 2022. The study is being carried out in co -operation with the Austrian 
"Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Interior, the Women’s Section in the Federal Chancellery and the "
Ministry of Social Affairs.  
 
A study in the field of clinical forensic  is currently about to be commissioned. Proper forensic 
evidence of traces of violence is of particular importance for criminal proceedings. The report of the 
study is expected towards the end of 2022 and shall include an evaluation of the status quo as well 
as a concept to improve the situation and to expand the supply of clinical forensic outpatient 
departments in Austria.  
 
2.5 Other pertinent developments   
The budget of the Directorate General for Women and Equality was increased to 18.4 million EUR 
in 2022  (and reflects an increase by 81% from 2019 to 2022). A large part of the budget is allocated 
to measures combating violence against women and girls.  
 
The Directorate General for Women and Equality launched a call for a project grant over 1.6 million 
EUR in 2021 for projects regarding the “protection and prevention of women and girls against 
"violence” . The projects are currently being implemented (until December 31, 2022).  "
 
Another call for projects on the topic of “measures to empower girls and women i n the digital 
"sphere and to diversify their educational path and career choices with a focus on mathematics, "
"computer science, natural sciences and technology”  was launched in spring/summer 2022. The call "
"aims to strengthen the protection against dangers on the internet, such as cyber grooming, cyber "
39 
 stalking or other forms of cyber violence. The implementation period for selected projects stretches 
from Novembe r 2022 to December 2023.  
 
3. Strategic objective: Ensure the equal access of women to justice  
 
.3.4 Research and awareness raising  
To further promote awareness on the Equal Treatment Commission a short flyer was published in 
2022.  
 
3.5 Other pertinent developments . 
The budget for government -funded counselling services for women  has been increased significantly 
"since 2019. Counselling services for women and girls has been strengthened, specialist -counselling "
services for those affected by sexual violenc e have been established in all Austrian provinces and a 
new counselling service to increase support for those affected by forced marriage has been set up 
in Western Austria.  
 
4. Strategic objective: Achieve balanced participation of women and men in political and public 
decision -making  
 
4.4 Research and awareness raising  
"Mentoring/work -shadowing programmes, confidence building, leadership and media training for "
women considering entering political and public decision -making is being offered to membe rs of the 
Federal Civil Service staff.  
 
"As part of the Federal Civil Service’s staff development program, a cross -mentoring scheme  is "
available to promotion of women’s careers. One distinctive feature of this particular cross -
"mentoring scheme is that manag ers from one Ministry (i.e., the mentors) support their female "
"colleagues from other Ministries (i.e., the mentees). This is a specific programme to support women "
in their career with around 30% of the mentors being male. The mentors pass on their experien ce 
"and knowhow, give advice on career planning and facilitate access to professional networks. Since "
"2005, about 1,400 mentors and mentees have participated in this program.  "
 
Women often attend Media training programmes  in order to strengthen their self -confident 
"rhetoric and appearance. Other trainings, such as “ Power Talking ”, are designed especially for "
female attendants to empower them in their career steps.  
 
The extent to which women are represented in managerial positions  is a central issue when it comes 
"to equal rights in the workplace. For one thing, management responsibility entails a wider scope of "
"action and increased decision -making powers; for another, it correlates with levels of pay, making it "
one of the decisive factors in the income gap between women and men. The different pay grades 
within the qualification -based pay schemes therefore provide a good way of identifying staff with 
"management responsibility, allowing for efficient, up -to-date gender audits . The percentage of "
"women at all levels of management rose from 27.7% to 37.1% since 2006, a trend that continued "
"across the board in 2021. In December 2021, the proportion of women at the Federal Civil Service’s "
"top level of management (i.e., directors ge neral) was 35.9%. Out of 78 directorates general, 28 were "
"headed by women, the highest proportion since 1995. In 1995 only two directors general out of 79 "

6. Strategic objective: Achieve gender mainstreaming in all policies and measures  
 
6.1 Legislative changes   
"Gender equality is an important aspect of performance management in Austria , which is a results -"
oriented strategy on the federal level of government. The budgetary principle of promoting gender 
equality  was incorporated in the Austrian Constitution in 2009 and came into effect in 2013 by 
introducing the Federal Budget Act. Another important legal framework is the regulatory impact 
assessments principles regulation  in which the federal chancellery (in acc ordance with the federal 
"ministry of finance) defines the dimensions for the impact assessment (see below). Additionally, the "
"Federal Ministries Act gives responsibility to the Federal Ministry for Arts, Culture, Civil Service and "
Sport for the cross -minis try co -ordination of actual gender equality.  
 
The system of performance management  has two distinct instruments: performance budgeting  and 
regulatory impact assessments . Both instruments play a crucial role in achieving gender equality in 
Austria. The prog ress of gender equality is evaluated and reported annually.  
 
The instrument of performance budgeting ensures that  all ministries and supreme organs define 
"gender -related outcome objectives , measures and indicators. The Federal Budget Act includes "
different  subdivisions. Each sub -division can define up to five impact goals. One out of the five goals 
"shall be gender related. In the budget of 2021, 32 divisions defined 35 gender -related impact goals. "
This significantly increases the transparency of government action in this field and guarantees the 
integration of gender perspectives in all areas of policy making.  
 
The instrument of regulatory impact assessments analyses the impact  of different measures taken 
by the government. The impact is analysed by means of  different dimensions (eight in total). One of 
"the dimensions is gender equality. Hence, the impact assessment includes a mandatory gender "
"impact dimension for all regulatory impact assessments. All new laws, regulations and projects, in "
"all fields, need t o be analysed concerning their impact on equality. This entrenches the awareness "
for equality throughout the public administration and consequently raises the need to invest in skills 
to analyse these impacts.  
 
6.4 Research and awareness raising  
Austria  celebrated the anniversary of gender mainstreaming  in 2020.  Activities and events took 
place throughout Austria with the common goal of focussing more on gender equality and on the

and/or awareness -raising activities. The Federal Academy of Public Administration 
(Verwaltungsakademie) offers specific courses  to raise gender competence at the federal level.  
 
Training courses may aim to foster and improve knowledge of the legal framework to fac ilitate the 
"implementation of the relevant policies, they may train executives to support equal treatment of "
"women and men as employees, or train female employees to better communicate their aims and "
"preferences with a view to career progression. These cou rses are not obligatory, however.  "

"- From January 2021 to January 2022, a scientific research project was conducted into low -"
"threshold, directly accessible centers for tackling domestic violence. The aim is to develop, "
"based on current good practices (see i.a. chain approach and Family Justice Centers), an "
intersectoral and multidisciplinary model on tackling domestic violence. For the 
"development and support of these centers, the Flemish Government invests an annual "
budget of 9 million euros.  
- In October 2020 the Flem ish action plan on Sexual Violence was launched. In addition to 
"an ongoing evaluation, an update of the plan is foreseen at the end of 2022. Meanwhile "
different measures have been taken:  
o A study has been launched to implement a ‘tool for detecting violence  by 
"professionals’ in different sectors such as sports, education, culture and justice.  "
o Several campaigns were launched to raise awareness of (domestic) violence. 
"Campaigns focused for example on the role of bystanders, but also to get to know "

"The Flemish government supports the FMDO project: ""Listening ears for Ukrainian women in "
"Flanders and Brussels"" in reaction to the sexual violence problem. Project starts on 15 September "
and runs for one year. Budget 97K. ‘Listening ears’ are trained women fr om different communities 
who act as confidants for (potential) victims. They can do this via phone (hotline) but also in 
informal group discussions with women. Signals concerning violence are collected and passed on 
to the relevant services. The listening ears are therefore the intermediaries who provide a warm 
referral to the local assistance services.

Centres for General Welfare in Flanders: Primary psychosocial care for Ukrainian refugees and their 
direct social environment  
"Since the start of the current crisis, the Flemish government took different measures within the "
"domain of Welfare, Public Health and Family. One of these measures consists of the reinforcement "
"of the 11 Centres for General Welfare (CAW, Centra Algemeen Welzijnswerk) in Flanders  and "
Brussels in function of primary psychosocial care for Ukrainian refugees and their direct social 
"environment. By direct social environment we mean the host families, as they are also confronted "
with psychosocial questions and needs. This policy is not  categorically aimed at female refugees. 
"Yet, the vast majority of the reached group are women (cf. Influx of refugees). The offered support "
"is free, accessible and proactive. If it appears from the primary care that specialised trauma "
"treatment is necessa ry, the client will be guided in a warm, caring manner to a (more specialised) "
"mental health centre. With a total budget of €2.659.500, we aim at reaching 2700 persons. When "
"70% of this target (i.e., 1890 persons) has been achieved, it will be evaluated wh ether or not this "
measure will be upscaled. The proportion of reached women with this measure is 73% (cf. 
quarterly report by CAW). The Centres for General Welfare report biweekly (focus on numbers) 
and quarterly (more profoundly) on the progress of this m easure. The execution of this measure 
"is followed up by a mixed (administration, cabinet and CAW) steering group. Current available "
reports (latest available biweekly report: 08 Aug.) learn that more than 1100 persons were helped.

1. Strategic objective: Prevent and combat gender stereotypes and sexism  
 
1.1 Legislative changes . 
"The Bulgarian Constitution follows the international standard and introduces the  term ""incitement "
"of enmity"" as the main limit of the right to express an opinion under Article 39, paragraph 2 of the "
"Constitution. According to the Constitutional Court, the restriction on speeches that constitute "
incitement to enmity is based on values such as tolerance and mutual respect enshrined in the 
"Constitution, as well as on the prohibition to propagate hatred on racial, national, ethnic or religious "
"grounds. In a decision, devoted to freedom of speech, the Constitutional Court stated that, by vi rtue "
"of important international treaties, states can declare as an offense punishable by law the "
"propagation of hatred on racial, national or religious grounds ( Article 4 of the International "
"Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimina tion, as well as Articles 162 - 164 of "
the Criminal Code). The rights that the norms against enmity and hate (“hate speech”) protect are 
of a degree of importance that justifiably opposes the right to freely make such speech. In 
"accordance with these princ iples in the Bulgarian legislation, these acts are elevated to a crime in "
"Article 162, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code (NC): Whoever, through speech, print or other means "
"of mass information, through electronic information systems or in any other way prea ches or incites "
"discrimination, violence or hatred based on race, nationality or ethnicity, shall be punished with "
"imprisonment from one to four years and a fine from five thousand to ten thousand BGN, as well as "
public reprimand.  
 
"The protection of religi ous confessions is provided for in the Penal Code in Article 164, which "
"criminalises the same acts as under Article 162, with the same means, but based on a religious basis, "
"and in this crime the prescribed punishment is greater: Who preaches or incites di scrimination, "
"violence or hatred on a religious basis through speech, print or other means of mass information, "
"through electronic information systems or in any other way, shall be punished with imprisonment "
"for up to four years or with probation, as well as with a fine of five thousand to ten thousand BGN. "
Another act that is criminalised and carried out through hate speech is provided for in Article 108 of 
the Criminal Code. It criminalises as a crime against the republic the preaching of a fascist or oth er 
anti-democratic ideology or forcible change of the social and state system established by the 
Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria. The prescribed penalty is imprisonment for up to three years 
"or a fine of up to BGN 5,000.  "
 
"Clear and direct inciteme nt to genocide is also subject to a criminal sanction, as per Article 416, "
paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code is punishable by imprisonment from one to eight years.  
 
"In Article 419a of the Criminal Code criminalises justifying, denying or grossly belittling in any way "
"the commission of a crime against peace and humanity, which creates a danger of using violence or "
"provoking hatred towards individuals or groups of people united by race, colour, religion, origin, "
national or ethnic origin.  
 
"Protection against h ate speech is also provided under the Protection against Discrimination Act, "
when the act does not fall into the forms raised to a crime. Protection is direct against hate speech 
"when it is directed at different groups or representatives of these groups, u nited on a certain basis, "
"and above all at their identity, equality and right to self -determination  "
 
"The Law on Radio and Television imputes with Article 17, paragraph 2 obligation of media service "
providers not to allow the creation of broadcasts or their  provision for distribution in violation of the 
"principles of Article 10 of the Criminal Code, as well as broadcasts inciting intolerance, glorifying or "
"exonerating cruelty or violence. According to the Bulgarian court, when the so -called ""hate speech"" "
"used in a radio or television broadcast, it is assessed whether there is a specific sign by which a "
"certain group could be identified, in order to justify the corresponding insinuation of intolerance "
69 
" towards this particular group. Through its Code of Ethics, the Bulgarian media undertake not to "
"publish material inciting or encouraging hatred, violence and any form of discrimination and not to "
"indicate race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, mental or physical condition, if these facts are "
not of essenti al importance about the meaning of the information.  
 
 For Example: Bulgarian Academy of sc ience (BAS) adopted a Plan for promotion of equality between 
"women and men for the period 2022 -2027, which covers all the main activities resulting from the "
responsibility of the BAS in accordance with the normative and strategic documents at the European 
and national level containing prescriptions for the promotion of equality between women and men 
in science. The academic institutes and others other independent units of BAS declare their 
commitment and determination to observe strictly the principle of eq uality between women and 
men and anti -discrimination based on gender in their activities and also prepared and approved their 
equality plans.  
 
"In March 2022, the Academic Council of the International Business School approve a Plan for equality "
"between women and men for the period 2022 -2026, which make the IBS one of the first universities "
"in Bulgaria, approved this kind of plan. The Economic Univ ersity – Varna also approved a Plan for "
equality between women and men for the period 2022 -2023. As well the Technical University – Sofia 
and Agrobioinstitute Agriculture Academy also approved Plans for equality between women and 
men for the period 2022 -2026.  
 
There are also other universities and research funding organization who already prepared and 
approved their action plans.  
 
The Ministry of Labour and Social Policy is in the process of development of a National action plan 
for promotion of equality b etween women and men for the period 2023 -2024.  
 
1.2 Policy changes  
With the adoption of the Gender Equality Act in 2016 in Bulgaria are functioning the so -called 
"""gender equality co -ordinators"" at national and regional level. Co -ordinators periodically participate "
"in training to share knowledge, lessons learned and good practices in the field of equality and "
mainstreaming initiatives of the public authorities.  
 
"Under the Commission for Protection against discrimination works regional representatives , whi ch "
"are located in 24 of the 28 districts in the country, a fact that is unique in Europe. Their commitment "
"is, in addition to providing independent assistance to citizens, to advise and inform them about the "
"application of the anti -discrimination law, abou t the powers and rules of proceedings before the "
"Criminal Code, about the legal options for protecting the violated right to equal treatment, including "
for their procedural powers in the proceedings before the Commission. They assist and support the 
"genera l will for tolerance, tolerance and the achievement of gender equality in public life.  "
 
1.3 Institutional changes e.. 
"In 2022, the composition of the National Council of equality between women and men at the Council "
"of Ministers was renewed. The Council is constantly active, co -ordinating and advising body, which "
supports the Council of Ministers in the development and implementation of the state policy on 
"gender equality and is a body for provision of consultation, co -operation and co -ordination between "
central and regional executive bodies and the structures of the civil society. The Council comprises 
"representatives of ministries, state and executive agencies and other authorities, established by law; "
national organizations representing employers and em ployees and workers; the National 
Association of Municipalities in the Republic of Bulgaria; and legal non -profit entities. The main 
priority areas of the National Council's work are in correspondence with the five priority areas in the 
National strategy f or the promotion of equality between women and men 2021 -2030 and the action 
70 
" plans for its implementation, which are mentioned above. One of these priorities is exactly the "
"overcoming of the stereotypes, existing in different spheres of the public life and sexism.  "
 
Persons who feel discriminated against or who need protection and ensuring equality in treatment 
or in opportunities to participate in public life can contact the Commission for Protection against 
Discrimination . Protection Against Discrimination  Act regulate the protection against all forms of 
"discrimination based on sex, race, nationality, ethnicity, human genome, citizenship, origin, religion "
"or belief, education, belief, political affiliation, personal or social status, disability, age, sexual  "
"orientation, marital status, property status or any other grounds established by law or in an "
"international treaty, to which the Republic of Bulgaria is a party. The proceedings before the "
Commission are free of state taxes. The meetings of the Commission  are open. The Commission's 
decisions are subject to appeal in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Code within 14 days 
of their notification to the interested parties. According to the data prepared by the Commission for 
"Protection against discrim ination, Bulgaria under the grounds mentioned above for 2021 there are "
"629 proceeding before the Commissions based on complains, signals and self -initiative of the "
Commission. For the period January -September 2022 there are 320 proceedings based on all 
grounds except the ground “sex”.  
 
In connection with the numerous complaints regarding the use of sexual stereotypes in commercial 
communications received by the National Council for Self -Regulations and on the basis of the 
"National Ethical Rules for Advertising and Commercial Communicatio n in the Republic of Bulgaria, "
the Ethics Commission of the Council for Self -Regulations accepts that opposition to gender 
stereotyping is necessary at all levels in society to promote equality and co -operation between 
"women and men in the private and publ ic spheres. In this regard, the National Council for Self -"
Regulation issues Recommendations on the use of sexual stereotypes in advertising and commercial 
communication. The Recommendations specifically state that “Advertising and commercial 
"communications  should avoid explicit or implicit insinuation of gender subordination, sexual "
violence and sexism.” https://www.nss -bg.org/pres -kodeks  
 
1.4 Research and awareness raising  
A type of research and a way to measure the implementation of the anti -discrimination policy is the 
"Report on the equality between women and men , which the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy "
prepared annually. In it are involved the results of the implem entation of the measures set out in 
"the National strategy for promotion of equality between women and man, national action plans for "
promotion of equality between women and men and other initiatives. It is adopted by the Council 
of Ministers. The document reflects the results of the implementation of the policies in five priority 
areas: equality of women and men in the labour market and equal degree of economic 
"independence, reduction of gender differences in pay and income, promotion of equality of women "
"and men in the processes of taking solutions, combating violence and protecting and supporting "
"victims, overcoming gender stereotypes in various spheres of public life and sexism.  "
 
The Commission for Protection against Discrimination  also monitoring and con trol the proceedings 
"based on complains, signals and/or self -initiative of the Commission.  "
 
"For example for 2021 there are 629 proceeding (on the ground of sex - 12, race - 2, nationality - 2, "
"ethnicity - 40, human genome - 2, citizenship - 3, origin - 12, religion or belief, - 20 education - 12, "
"belief - 20 political affiliation - 4, personal or social status - 156, disability - 248, age - 32, sexual "
"orientation - 8, sexual harassment – 8, marital status - 12, property status – 17, exercise of trade "
union activity - 4). 
 
"For the period January -September 2022 there are 320 proceedings (on the ground of sex - 10, race "
"- 2, nationality - 2, ethnicity - 17, human genome - 2, citizenship - 7, origin - 3, religion or belief - 5, "
"education - 23, belief - 23, pol itical affiliation - 10, personal or social status - 116, disability - 55, age "
71 
" - 22, sexual harassment - 3, marital status - 3, property status – 9, exercise of trade union activity – "
8) 
 
"A type of awareness -raising campaign is the procedure of announcement , applications of the "
"candidates, selection of national and local institutions, business and non -profit organizations, public "
organizations and institutions and award event for the Label of major accomplishments in the 
"effective implementation of the gende r equality policy , which is annual initiative of the Minister of "
Labour and Social Policy. The main purpose of this label is to encourage the efforts of more and more 
"institutions/organizations, as well as the competition between them in the implementation  of "
policies and good practices in the field of equality between women and men.  
 
"A Handbook “The Boys and the professions, related with care giving” for teachers and career "
consultant for work with boys and for gender sensitive career orientation as part of the European 
project BOYS IN CARE - Encouraging of the boys to choose care -related professions. The aim is to 
"provide professionals who work with boys, information on how to support their choice of education "
"and profession, usually associated with provi ding or providing care - to children, to people of the "
"third age or to people in a difficult health or social situation, such as social work, social and health "
"care, services in the period of early childhood development, elementary pedagogy, etc. Under the  "
focus of the Handbook is on building the capacity of career guidance professionals to develop gender 
sensitivity in their work. This is necessary because such professions are often considered more 
"suitable for women than for men, due to existing stereotyp es in society about the gender division of "
professions and the spheres of activity of women and men.  
 
"With regard to those seeking international protection, the State Agency for Refugees under the "
Council of Ministers implements measures in this area that aim to ensure their adaptation and 
"prevent any form of exploitation, abuse, violence or discrimination. Identification of the special "
"needs of asylum seekers begins at the earliest possible stage, allowing for immediate action to refer "
to specialist care a nd services. The assessment of the risk of violence is carried out by the officials in 
"the process of registration, accommodation, medical examination, conducting a social interview and "
during the procedure for granting international protection.  
 
"In the te rritorial structures of the international organization for migration, have been placed "
"brochures on human trafficking and voluntary return, which have been translated into various "
"languages - Pashto, Dari, Arabic, Farsi and English There are screens showin g films with information "
on the prevention of human trafficking on the following topics: Human trafficking for the purpose of 
labour exploitation; Human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation; Protection of 
"unaccompanied children, victims of hu man trafficking and General information on the problems of "
human trafficking and the protection provided by official institutions.  
 
The films are provided by the National Commission for Combating Human Trafficking and are 
bundled with other information mat erials and aim to inform and prevent cases of trafficking. The 
Standard Operating Procedures for Prevention and Response to Sexual and Gender -Based Violence 
have been updated. The procedures provide a clear notification and guidance system to inform 
surviv ors or witnesses how to respond. The procedure for experienced violence by applicants for 
international protection is included in the Standard Operating Procedures for Prevention and 
Response to Sexual and Gender -Based Violence. A number of projects have b een implemented 
"against gender -based violence against women and children, asylum seekers and migrants – “Mission "
"Wings” (Misia Krile), supported by UNICEF - Bulgaria and funded by the US Department of State, "
"""SAVE - Speak out against violence"" - phase 3, i mplemented by the Council of Refugee Women in "
"Bulgaria, financed by UNICEF and others.  "
 
"Regarding those seeking protection from the war in Ukraine, registration for residence as "
"beneficiaries of temporary protection, migration authorities refer displaced p ersons from Ukraine "
to Public Employment Services (PES).  
72 
  
"During the first three months, a mobile team of the territorial divisions of the PES is at the border "
"points with Romania and along the sea border every day, and afterwards, the teams periodically v isit "
"border points. In addition, the mobile teams visit transport nodes and crisis headquarters for the "
"arrival of Ukrainian citizens (Sofia, Plovdiv, Gabrovo, Burgas, Varna, Lovech, Targovishte, Silistra, "
etc.).  
 
The mobile teams (106) to the labour offi ces visit every place where there are groups of settled 
"Ukrainians, provide information about PES services, and conduct surveys. The representatives of the "
labour offices are in constant contact with the local authorities and participate in the work of the  
headquarters at the local level.  
 
The Bulgarian Government has launched a unified information portal named “Bulgaria for Ukraine” 
to help people fleeing Ukraine. The portal is the first of its kind in the European Union and contains 
"key information about the rights with regard to crossing the border into an EU country, eligibility for "
temporary protection and applying for international protection.  
 
"The site to visit is https://gov.bg/bg/ukraine (translated into Ukrainian, English and Russian):  "
"а section o n the website ""Job opportunities for Ukrainian citizens"", containing information on access "
to the labour market; conditions and life in Bulgaria;  
links to a survey for employers willing to hire Ukrainian citizens and a survey on the attitudes of 
Ukrainians to work in Bulgaria;  
publication of weekly information on the results of surveys conducted among Ukrainian citizens and 
employers;  
"""Business cards"" of the surveys for Ukrainians and employers with links to the two surveys for "
"employers and Ukrai nians and ""business cards"" with a QR code for direct access to the surveys via "
mobile devices;  
Provision of generated QR codes for easy and quick access to surveys via mobile devices;  
The National hotline of Bulgaria for Ukraine is staffed in 3 languages by a team of over 20 people.  
 
"Foremost among the challenges is the language barrier, which hampers the Ukrainian citizens from "
freely communication and thus finding a job. Many of the Ukrainian citizens have arrived without 
documents for acquired education  and professional qualifications thus it is difficult for them to 
occupy jobs with certain requirements. They are predominantly women who are engaged in caring 
for children and/or elderly relatives.  
 
"In this regard, the overall needs of these citizens are as follow: training in the Bulgarian language, "
"services for raising/education of children and for support for the elderly and sick relatives, the "
possibility of recognition of acquired qualifications and education. Psychological support is needed 
"for some citizens of Ukraine as well as training for the acquisition of a vocational qualification, which "
should be tailored to the demand of the Bulgarian labour market and in the specific region where 
the person is located.  
 
"After amendments to the Employment Pro motion Act the Ukrainian citizens, benefiting from "
"temporary protection, acquired the rights of Bulgarian jobseekers and thus can use the public "
"employment services provided by the labour offices, as well as to participate in programmes and "
measures for em ployment and training.  
 
  
73 
 1.5 Other pertinent developments  
The Council for electronic media (CEM) conducted a focused monitoring on the topic of equality 
between of women and men. For example in 2021 CEM reported for the predominance of men 
over women during the three election`s campaign. The data from the participation of men and 
women in radio and TV programmes show domination of the men against the women.  
 
In connection with the four election campaigns held in the last year - three times for parliame nt 
"and once for the head of state, the Council for Electronic Media published a Report of the "
Monitoring of Audio and Audio -visual Content in an election campaign for parliament from the 
perspective of participation of women and men https://www.cem.bg/controlbg/1371 . 
 
"The monitoring of elections ""two in one"" - elections for president and vice president and "
extraordinary elections for parliament once again found that the participation of men in pre -
election content quantitatively exceeds the participation of women. Accor ding to the publicly 
"announced candidacies for president and vice president (23 couples), there are 191 male "
candidates for head of state and 4 female candidates. There are 9 male and 14 female candidates 
"for vice president. According to CEC data for the p arliamentary vote, out of a total of 5 068 87 "
"candidates for people's representatives (6,306 candidates as one person can be registered in two "
"lists), there are 1 515 female candidates (1 882 total candidates in both lists) against 3 553 male "
candidates (4  424 total applications in two lists). https://www.cem.bg/controlbg/1402  
 
It can be concluded that the achievement of equality between women and men in the legislation 
still requires work and remains an imp ortant goal for the democratic Bulgarian society.  
 
2. Strategic objective: Prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence  
 
2.1 Legislative changes  
"Having regard to the judgment of the Constitutional Court delivered on 27 July 2018, by which the "
Court ruled that the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against 
"Women and Domestic Violence, opened for signature on 11 May 2011 in Istanbul, signed from the "
"Republic of Bulgaria on 21.04.2016, does not comply with the Constitution of the Republic of "
"Bulgaria, our country is not able to ratify this international act, as well as to accede to any part of it.  "
 
"In 2013, by a decision of the Council of Ministers in Bulgaria, a National Human Rights Co -ordination "
"Mechanism  was established, as a result of the need to take concrete steps towards improving co -"
ordination between state authorities and independent institutions dealing with various aspects of 
human rights . The main priority areas in its activity are aimed at dist ributing among the state bodies 
and institutions the fulfilment of the obligations related to the permanent dialogue and periodic 
national reports to the international human rights control and monitoring mechanisms; discussion 
of the expediency of the Repu blic of Bulgaria's accession to international treaties in the field of 
"human rights; proposing the initiation of legislative changes in the field of human rights, as well as "
proposing measures to improve the human rights situation in the country.  
 
  
74 
  
2.2 Policy changes  
The institutional mechanism for the equality of women and men regulated in the Law on equality 
between women and men. It creates a normative framework for conducting state policy in this area. 
Its main goal is to promote the achievemen t of equality between women and men by creating 
"conditions for building a sustainable institutional environment, defining the bodies and working "
mechanisms for implementing the state policy on equality between women and men. One of the 
principles on which the state policy on the equality of women and men based is the equal treatment 
of women and men and the non -admission of discrimination and violence based on gender. This 
principle is also reflected in the current National Strategy for promoting the equali ty of women and 
men for the period 2021 -2030 (adopted by the Council of Ministers with Decision 969 of December 
"30, 2020), in which one of the five priority areas is indicated “Combating violence and protecting and "
"supporting victims”. Since 2005, the Stra tegy has been implemented through annual National Action "
"Plans for promotion of equality between women and men, which are adopted by the Council of "
Ministers and contain specific measures proposed according to the priorities of the Strategy by the 
"relevant  competent institutions and organizations, responsible bodies, financial means and "
indicators for execution. In the current Action Plan for promotion of equality of women and men 
2021 -2022 a number of measures are included in priority area 4: Combating vio lence and protection 
and support of the victims.  
 
"The National Programme for the Prevention and Protection of Domestic Violence for 2022 , "
"adopted by Decision 321 of the Council of Ministers of 20 of May 2022, also provides specific "
measures and legislative  changes aimed at increasing public awareness and sensitivity to domestic 
"violence issues , creating a mechanism for the protection of victims of domestic violence and "
improving co -ordination and interaction between the various state authorities and the or ganizations 
involved in the problem.  
 
"At the beginning of the current year 2022, a working group was formed to update and finalise the "
project of the amendment act of the Protection Against Domestic Violence Act. In intensive 
"meetings, the wide range of e xperts participating in the working group reached an agreement on "
the key controversial topics raised within the framework of the public discussion of the draft act in 
"2021, as a result of which a draft of amendments act to the Protection Against Domestic Violence "
"Act was prepared violence, which was the subject of a conciliation procedure. The main reason for "
the adoption of the draft Law on Amendments and Supplements to the Law on Protection from 
Domestic Violence is the extreme aggravation of domestic vi olence in the last few years and an 
"increase in the number of victims and victims, which makes the problem a priority.  "
 
"The aggravation of domestic violence, especially in the conditions of the pandemic, puts the question "
of solving it in a priority place.  According to the exported statistics after the announcement of the 
"global pandemic in all countries, incl. and in Bulgaria, there is an escalation of violence and, in "
"particular, an escalation of violence against women. There are no official statistics in  Bulgaria, but "
"according to the latest data from the Ministry of the Interior, there has been an increase in the "
number of reports of domestic violence registered and recorded on the Single European Emergency 
Call Number (EEN 112). According to data from t he national hotline for victims of violence (0800 1 
"8676 or 02/981 76 86), provided by the ""Animus Association"" Foundation, over the last three years "
there has been a high growth in the number of people seeking help and counselling due to domestic 
violence  and on this line . The comparative analysis of the Ministry of the Interior shows that there 
"is also an increase in the total number of protection orders issued, considering that in most cases "
"one protection order protects the rights of two, three or more  persons. The number of immediate "
"protection orders issued also increased, as did the number of injured men. The high growth of cases "
with injured women is similar.  
 
"According to Article 6, paragraph 7 of the Protection Against Domestic Violence Act (PADVA ), "
annually the budget of the Ministry of Justice determines funds for financing projects of non -profit 
75 
" legal entities that carry out activities under this law, for development and implementation of "
programmes for prevention and protection from domestic vi olence.  
 
2.3 Institutional changes  
In the Ministry of Interior was appointed a national co -ordinator for domestic and gender -based 
violence. His deputies and the regional co -ordinators were appointed in the regional directorates of 
the Ministry of Interior to support the activities of MoI employees.  
 
2.4 Research and awareness raising  
"In 2022, the Ministry of Justice assigned the implementation of a sociological survey of attitudes "
towards domestic violence and the Domestic Violence Protection Act. From the research was 
established that the domestic violence is recognised as a topic of high public importance. Every 9 
out of 10 share that domestic violence is a serious public problem. One third of the respondents 
declare that they are familiar wi th cases of domestic violence in their immediate social circle. While 
"expectedly residents of Sofia and big cities are more sensitive on the subject, significantly more "
survey participants from villages declare that they are familiar with cases of domestic  violence in 
their social circle. The survey found that there is a high level of public engagement with the topic of 
domestic violence and the need for measures against this social phenomenon. The experience with 
domestic violence and the attitudes towards  the subject are relatively equally represented among 
"the different age groups, with the highest share according to the first indicator being among the "
"people on 50 -59 year of age. Although fewer women share about cases of domestic violence, their "
higher d egree of commitment to the problem is evident. It is important to note that the same 
conclusion applies to almost 90% of the men in the study. The majority of the surveyed citizens 
"(95%) believe that protection from domestic violence should be available to  all persons, including "
"minors and people with disabilities. According to the study, the fear of abuse of the law in the "
conflicts between spouses/partners in possible family conflicts is the first risk area. Nearly 60% of 
the people surveyed share critica l attitudes towards the current Protection Against Domestic 
Violence Act and believe that the national legal framework does not fulfil its main functions for the 
protection and prevention of victims and persons at risk.  
 
3. Strategic objective: Ensure the  equal access of women to justice  
 
3.1 Legislative changes  
The legislation in force in Bulgaria guarantees equal opportunities and prohibits discrimination. The 
principles of non -discrimination in the country are enshrined at the highest possible legislative level 
"– in the Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria,  according to which all people are born free and "
"equal in dignity and rights and no restrictions of rights or privileges based on a number of signs, "
"including sex, personal and social status, are allowed. Protection against all forms of discrimination "
"is guaranteed by a special Protection against Discrimination Act, ensuring equality before the law, "
equality of treatment and opportunities for participation in public life and effective protection 
against discrimination. This act sets out the prohibition of a ny direct or indirect discrimination based 
"on sex, race, nationality, ethnicity, human genome, citizenship, origin, religion or belief, education, "
"belief, political affiliation, personal or social status, disability, age, sexual orientation, marital status , "
"property status or any other grounds established by law or in an international treaty, to which the "
Republic of Bulgaria is a party.  
 
In accordance with the anti -discrimination provisions of the Constitution are also the provisions of 
"the Labour Code, a ccording to which no direct or indirect discrimination based on sex and other "
"grounds, including sexual orientation, marital and material status, mental or physical disability, is "
"allowed in the exercise of labour rights and obligations. Under the Labour C ode, women and men "
are entitled to equal pay for equal or equivalent work. Anti -discrimination provisions related to sex 
"and marital status are contained in a number of other regulations, such as the Family Code, "
"Employment Promotion Act, the Social Assist ance Act  and others. The Social Security Code  "
76 
 introduces the principles of compulsory and universal insurance and equal treatment of insured 
persons.  
 
"According to Article 9 of LPD the burden of proof is reversed ""in proceedings for protection against "
discrimination after the party alleging discrimination present facts on the basis of which it can be 
"assumed that there is discrimination, the respondent must prove that the principle of equal "
treatment has not been breached “. Commission for Protection again st Discrimination (CPD) created 
"pursuant to LPD is an independent government body to prevent discrimination, protect against "
discrimination and ensure equality of opportunities. Proceedings before the commission are 
"initiated on: a complaint of the persons  concerned, an initiative of the commission and signals from "
"individuals and legal entities, state and municipal bodies. No fees are charged for proceedings before "
the CPD. In fulfilment of the obligation to provide independent legal assistance to victims of 
"discrimination when filing complaints about discrimination (Article 47, item 9 of the Law on "

number 070018250 for the whole country. The National Legal Aid Telephone is a hotline where 
every citizen can get free legal advi ce. Legal advice is provided free of charge by telephone from 
lawyers selected through a competition.  
 
"With regard to victims of domestic violence or victims of crimes based on sex, sexual exploitation, "
"human trafficking, etc., our national legislation gua rantees access to justice by providing free "
"counseling and legal aid in connection with the preparation of complaints, signals, preparation of "
"claims, filing of cases and procedural representation before the bodies of the pre -trial proceedings "
"and the cour t. In the regional counseling centers, where the initial legal assistance is provided to "
"these persons, if necessary, the victims are referred to forensic doctors, doctors, psychologists, "
"Crisis centers providing social services, etc. Victims of domestic v iolence are exempt from payment "
of state fees for instituting protection cases under the Protection Against Domestic Violence Act. 
"The right to protection in the pre -trial and court proceedings of the victims of crimes is guaranteed, "
who do not have the op portunity to hire a contract lawyer and explicitly state that they wish to 
"have one. In these cases, the bodies of investigation and the court submit a request to the "
"respective Bar Council, in the area of which the act for appointment of an official lawye r, registered "
"in the National Register for Legal Aid at the NLAB, was committed.  "
 
The CPD provides free consultations when submitting complaints and signals in the reception of the 
"CPD, as well as in the offices of its regional representatives for all cit izens on the territory of the "
country  
 
3.3 Institutional changes  
The Commission for Protection against Discrimination is a body with competence to control the 
"application and observance of the laws regulating equality in treatment, exercising control over the "
application and observance of the Protection against Discrimination Act and other laws regulating 
"equality in treatment. It is an active state body for prevention, control and protection against "
"discrimination. In recent years, the number of compl aints and signals from citizens, legal entities, "
"state and local authorities and government, as well as non -governmental organizations has "
increased. It means that there is a sensitivity trend. More and more citizens are seeking protection 
of their violate d rights before the CPD.  
 
  
77 
  
3.4 Research and awareness raising  
"The Commission for Protection against Discrimination  (CPD) has regional representatives, which "
makes it unique in Europe. They have an obligation to provide independent legal assistance to 
"citizens, to advise and inform them of the implementation of the Law on Protection against "
"Discrimination , of the power s and rules of proceedings before the Commission, on the possibilities "
"to protect the violation of the right to equal treatment, including for their procedural powers in the "
proceedings before the CPD  
 
The Commission for Protection against Discrimination h as organised a number of seminars in recent 
years. The main purpose of the training is to consider the specifics of discrimination and to take it 
into account when considering cases.  
 
4. Strategic objective: Achieve balanced participation of women and men  in political and public 
decision -making  
 
4.1 Legislative changes  
"According to the provisions of the  Act on Equality between Women and Men , one of the principles "
of the state policy on equality between women and men is the balanced representation of women

ethnic minorities should be respected . 
 
4.5 Other pertinent developments  
In the EIGE Gender Equality Index 2021 Bulgaria is on 9th place in the EU in the domain of “Power”.  
 
"5. Strategic objective: Protect the rights of migrant, refugee and asylum -seeking women and girls  "
 
5.1 Legislative changes  
"In accordance with the requirements of the Law on asylum and refugees (LAR), every foreigner for "
whom the conditions and prerequisite provided by law are present has access to the procedure for 
granting protection on the territory of the Republic of Bulgar ia. The principle of non -discrimination 
on grounds of sex in proceedings for granting of international protection is derived from the general 
"rule of Article 20 of LAR, according to which no restrictions shall be allowed with respect to the rights "
"or privi leges of foreigners seeking or granted protection in the Republic of Bulgaria, based on race, "
"nationality, ethnic origin, sex, descent, religion, education, convictions, political affiliation, personal "
and social status or property status.  
 
"According to t he Qualification Directive (Directive 2011/95/EC), transposed into our national "
"legislation with the amendments to LAR, promulgated in SG, issue 80 of 2015, the aspects related to "
"sex, are duly taken into account for the determination of belonging to a soc ial group or the "
establishment of a characteristic of such a group. With the transposition of the Qualification 
"Directive, the definition of ""persons from a vulnerable group"" introduced in paragraph 1 item 17 of "
"the Additional Provisions of LAR was introdu ced, namely in this category fall minors or underage "
"persons, unaccompanied minors and underage persons, elderly people, pregnant women, single "
"parents with underage children, victims of trafficking in human beings, persons with serious health "
"problems, pe rsons with mental disorders, and persons who are victims of torture, rape or other "
"serious forms of mental, physical or sexual violence.  "
 
78 
" For full harmonization with the European legislation and standards, legal and organizational "
measures have been taken and implemented for optimization of the national system for granting 
international protection. Amendments to LAR have been introduced to upgrade and supplement the 
procedural guarantees for one of the most vulnerable groups - unaccompanied minors. Practica l 
legal provisions and mechanisms are in place to increase the quality of the proceedings for granting 
international protection. Provisions of Article 25 supplement procedural guarantees in accordance 
"with the principle of child's best interest, provided i n Article 25 of the Procedural Directive (Directive "
2013/32/EU) and respond to the European Commission's Recommendations for further 
"development of provisions concerning the representation of this vulnerable group. According to LAR, "
the function of represe ntatives of unaccompanied children - candidates for international protection 
is assigned to lawyers from the Register for Legal Aid of the National Office for Legal Assistance with 
the Ministry of Justice. In this way greater speed and efficiency in the ap pointment of a 
representative is achieved. There is no need for carrying out additional actions and procedures for 
providing legal aid and the required standard for the necessary knowledge and skills to perform this 
"function is provided. The obligations of  the representative are regulated, requiring the necessary "
"knowledge to assist the child in the procedure of granting international protection, including "
"informing the child about the meaning and possible consequences of the personal interview and, if "
"nece ssary, how to prepare for it. It is regulated that a representative cannot be a person whose "
interests are in conflict or could possibly be in conflict with the interests of the unaccompanied child.  
 
"With the changes introduced in Article 30a of LAR, a wor king mechanism for identification and "
assessment of the needs of persons from vulnerable groups has been established. According to 
"Article 30a (1) of LAR, when the affiliation of a foreigner seeking interactional protection to a "
"vulnerable group or with sp ecial needs is established, the needs are identified and assessed, and if "
necessary a Support Plan is prepared. This mechanism ensures that the decision -making authority 
"has at its disposal all relevant information on the identified vulnerabilities, specia l procedural needs "
and opportunities to provide support. The documents prepared in this procedure are attached to 
the personal file of the foreigner and ensure that during the entire procedure for granting 
international protection the special procedural ne eds of the applicant for international protection 
"be taken into account, that he will be able to exercise his legal right and to perform his duties. The "
proceedings for granting of international protection for persons from vulnerable group is carried out 
by employees who have undergone additional training and qualification with focus on the specifics 
"of interviewing this category of persons, in particular the importance of the principle of child's best "
"interest. This presupposes peculiarities during the hea ring and observance of the right to an opinion, "
"as well as use of appropriate methods of communication according to the age, sex, culture and "
maturity of the person.  
 
"According to Article 3 of the Protection against Discrimination Act, all natural persons on the "
territory of the country have the right to protection.  
 
"According to Article 3, paragraph 2 Associations of natural persons, as well as legal entities, enjoy "
"the rights under this law when they are discriminated based on the grounds under Article 4,  "

2. Strategic objective: Prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence  
 
2.1 Legislative changes   
"MINISTRY OF EDUCATION, SPORTS AND YOUTH  "
 
Legislative Changes  
 
"In national laws, general references are made to the responsibility of the Ministry of Education for "
the provision of information on sexuality education to children and provision of training to  
educators. Sexuality Education is included in the Health Education curriculum. The topics that are 
"related to sexuality education are mostly included in the thematic unit ""Family Planning, Sexual and "
"Reproductive Health"". The topics are mostly included in  the thematic unit ""Family Planning, Sexual "
"and Reproductive Health"". The unit includes topics that are related to a holistic understanding of "
"sexual and reproductive health, such as the national and European legal framework, stereotypes, "
"domestic and othe r forms of violence, risky sexual behaviour, homophobia, the role of religion and "
"media, etc. These topics are approached in relation to the role of peer pressure, life values, gender "
"stereotypes, self -confidence, safety, human rights and responsibilities and substance abuse.  "
 
92 
" Sexuality education, as included in Health Education, may contribute to the prevention and dealing "
"of social problems such as sexual violence, bullying, unwanted pregnancies in teenagers, "
"homophobia, risky sexual behaviours, HIV/AIDS and other STDs, reproduction of gender stereotypes, "
"violence against women, stigmatisation and discrimination of marginalised groups such as LGBT "
"students etc. Based on the methodological approach of Health Education, sexuality education is "
"approached in a  way that no students, from any background, will feel insulted, excluded or "
"uncomfortable during the lesson. On the contrary, each student is empowered through their own "
"cultural and ethical framework in order to acquire the skills and adopt the attitudes,  values and "
behaviours which enhance their resistance to the early initiation of sexual activities and/or 
involvement in high -risk sexual behaviours.  
 
The learning objectives of sexuality education in the Health Education Curriculum aim to the 
promotion of  critical analysis of the various perspectives on issues of sexuality and not to a moralistic 
"position in favour of against any choice of sexual behaviour. Sexuality education, based on the Health "
"Education Curriculum, does not aim to teach what is ‘right’  or ‘wrong’ in relation to family planning "
"and sexual life - always in the context of international, European and national legal framework and "
of the International Declaration of Human Rights. The learning objectives are based on the health 
promotion appro ach and aim to provide opportunities to students in order to critically explore the 
"various social factors, which determine issues of sexuality, and to understand the ways in which "
"society may influence the attitudes, choices and behaviours of a person in relation to sexuality "
issues.

The Minister of Justice and Public Order has recently asked the Police to revise the Protocols that it 
"implements in  cases of dealing with victims of sexual violence and rape, in such a way as to fully "
incorporate the provisions of the Istanbul Convention. The said Protocols should also follow the 
"innovative provisions of the national legislation on gender -based violenc e, as well as the modernised "
"framework of the Penal Code, which in cases of rape places the lack of consent from the victim as a "
central reference point.  
 
"The new revised Protocols fully adopt and implement a victim -centred approach, through which the "
"victim is treated with respect, sensitivity; an individualised, professional and non -discriminatory "
approach. This is for all contact with law -enforcement authorities that operate within the penal 
"process, or with support services. The rights of women victims are fully guaranteed under conditions "
"of security, confidentiality and trust. This avoids the danger of secondary and repeated victimisation.  "

2. The National Strategy and Action Plan to Combat Sexual Abuse and Expl oitation of Children 
"and Child Pornography (""NS"") constitutes the basic policy text and guides the actions and initiatives "
of the Authorities of the Republic of Cyprus for the next three years. The elaboration of the NS was 
decided by the Council of Minist ers on 13/7/2015 and for this purpose an Inter -ministerial 
"Committee has been established, comprising the Ministers of Education and Culture, Labour, "
"Welfare and Social Security, Justice and Public Order and Health. The National Strategy and Action "

"School Violence, which has a four -year timeframe of implementation (2018 -2022). According to its "
"role and responsibilities, and based on the aforementioned Strategy, the Cyprus Observatory on "
School Violence (COSV) of the CPI has developed and imple mented actions that aim to prevent and 
address bullying and violence in schools. COSV provides support to school units for the 
"implementation of actions and programmes aimed at improving the school climate, with the "
"ultimate aim of reducing violence in sch ools. These programmes, which are school -based and they "
"have a two -year duration, are the “Conflict Resolution - School Mediation” and the “Recognition and "
Management of School Bullying”.  
 
"The COSV supports schools in the implementation of anti -bullying p rogrammes, which deal with "
"recognizing, preventing and combating bullying. With the “Conflict Resolution - School Mediation” "
schools are encouraged to find effective way of resolving student conflicts as well as alternative way 
of managing conflict situati ons at school.  
 
"Also, educational material to assist teachers on how to undertake activities with children to enhance "
their competences needed for prevention and management of school violence was produced and 
disseminated.  
 
"The curriculum of this material includes activities to enhance anger management, teambuilding, "
"empathy, emotional intelligence, social and communicative skills, tolerance, acceptance of diversity, "
"mediation skills, anti -bullying skills, conflict management  etc.  "
 
"It must also be noted that, the Ministry of Education in the framework of the implementation of the "
"National Strategy for the Prevention and Management of School Violence, in June 2018, announced "
an Open Tender for services by a researcher to condu ct a long -term research on the phenomenon 
of school violence.  
 
The responsibility for monitoring the implementation of the Convention was assigned to the 
"Observatory for Violence at School (COSV), within the terms of its mandate.  "
 
94 
" The project is part of the first section of this National Strategy, which provides for the creation of "
"mechanisms for data collection, coding and analysis and reporting of key outcomes around the "
"phenomenon, extent and forms of violence at school.  "
 
"The Mi nistry, through the creation of these mechanisms, seeks to monitor the phenomenon of "
"violence at school, identify needs and evaluate the effectiveness of existing "
"interventions/programmes in order to make research -based decisions and, in general, to formul ate "
effective policy.  
 
This research is the first step in the effort to reduce violence in the Cypriot population and is the first 
"to be addressed to all schools in Cyprus. It will be completed in four (4) school years, from the date "
of signing the Contra ct and includes data collection for three (3) consecutive years (2020 -2023) from 
"all Public and Private schools in Cyprus, of all levels (Pre -primary, Primary, Secondary General, "
"Secondary technical and Vocational. Moreover, the COSV collects data concerni ng good practices "

MINISTRY OF HEALTH  
(a) A factor that we consider likely to negatively affect the implementation of the policies and 
"measures mentioned above, concerns the need for the participation of civil society, something that "
can be implemented through targeted and continuous information campaigns aimed both at women 
"in thei r workspace as well as to women in their family space, and to cover women of all educational "
levels to enable the perception that every woman has a voice and rights that she can claim.  
 
"(b) By extension, the acceptance of the reforms will be promoted throu gh the information "
campaigns.  
"• Regarding the prevention and handling of sexual harassment at the workplace, educational "
seminars have been planned in order to transfer the necessary skills to the professionals’ members 
"of the Equality Committee, that are needed to handle and transfer these cases to the responsible "
authority.  
 
• Regarding the National Strategy and National Action Plan for the Prevention and Combating 
"of Violence against Women 2023 -2028, training of the health professionals through interacti ve "
"workshops, is necessary, in order to develop the communication skills that are needed to identify, "
"handle, help or/ and refer these incidents to the responsible services.  "
 
"DEPUTY MINISTRY OF RESEARCH, INNOVATION AND DIGITAL POLICY  "
 
Challenges  
 
Resistan ce to change  
Insufficient resources – human and financial to promote actions

"child at the same t ime. Additionally, parents will also be allowed to use the parental leave and "
"benefit by calendar days  until the child reaches the age of three. This means, for example, that the "
parent can continue to work part time after having a child by dividing the pa rental benefit over a

research methodology enabled to explain a significantly larger part of the gender pay gap in Estonia 
– 40% instead of previous 15%.  
 
"Aa a part of the gender pay gap research project, a prototype of a digital tool (Pay Mirror)  was "
"developed in co -operation with Tallinn University and Statistics Estonia. Using administrative data, "
"this tool will enable employers to measure and analyse the gender pay gap in their organisations, "
without in creasing the administrative burden. The Ministry of Social Affairs is responsible for 
developing this prototype further and make the digital tool available for the employers by 2024.  
 
Project “Nudging to Support Stereotype -free Career Choices and Working C onditions”  was finalised

To increase men`s participation in carrying the care burden and to increase the take -up of the 30 -
"calendar -day paternity leave , an applied research project, using the methods of behavioural "
psychology was carried out to test suitable nudges to achieve these aims. The project was finalised 
in 2022.  
 
A Gender Equality Monitory  was carried out in 2022. The survey included questions  to examine 
whether COVID -related restrictions changed the sharing of unpaid work and care duties between 
women and men in Estonian families. The results of the survey will be published in November 2022.  
 
"In 2019, the Ministry of Social Affairs started a n ew form of co -operation with civil society "

organisations. The first round of open calls for strategic partnerships to promote gender equality 
took place in 2 019. The second round of open calls for promotion of gender equality was announced 
in 2022 and resulted in three -year strategic partnership contracts with the Estonian Women’s 
Studies and Resource Centre and NGO Oma Tuba (together with Praxis Centre for Po licy Studies). 
The NGO Oma Tuba launched a feminist web magazine called Feministeerium (feministeerium.ee) 
"in 2015, which has currently approximately 11,000 readers per month. NGO Oma Tuba has raised "
106 
" awareness on various issues regarding gender inequality,  gender -based violence and the negative "
impact of gender stereotypes and has also promoted temporary special measures and a consent -
"based approach to rape, sexual violence and sexual assault in legislation. The Estonian Women’s "
Studies and Resource Centre (ENUT) has been publishing the first and only peer -reviewed academic 
"gender studies journal (Ariadne’s Clew) from 2000 -2018. After a short hiatus in 2018, ENUT plans to "
re-launch the journal in 2022 and continue publishing the magazine as a part of strateg ic partnership

5.2 Policy changes  
"Since 24 February 2022, when Russia launched a full -scale war against Ukraine, more than 55,000 "
"war refugees from Ukraine have fled to Estonia. Estonian society, government and state institutions, "
as well as private individuals and NGO -s are committed to helping the people of Ukraine who have 
fled their homes.  
 
"In accordance with a decision by the Estonian government, Ukrainian citizens and their family "
"members who fled Ukraine on or a fter February 24 are granted temporary protection, which "
"includes an Estonian residence permit valid for one year. Should the war in Ukraine continue, it is "
possible to extend temporary protection if necessary.  
 
107 
 Applying for temporary protection is not com pulsory for war refugees but will afford them the same 
access to different services and benefits as Estonian residents have. Temporary protection entitles 
"the person to accommodation and food, health care services, employment, benefits and allowances, "
"social services, education, language learning and an adjustment programme. As recipients of "
"temporary protection, the war refugees get the right to receive  subsistence benefits, family benefits, "
"social benefits, as well as labour market services and labour mar ket support  on the same basis as "
other people who live in Estonia permanently or temporarily.  
 
"34,900 war refugees from Ukraine have applied and been granted a temporary protection status. "
"Most of the receivers of a temporary protection status are women an d children. Out of 34,900 "
"people, 37% are underaged, 49% are women aged 18 or older, and 14% are men aged 18 or older.  "
 
Work  
"Once a person has been granted temporary protection, they can start working or register as "
"unemployed and therefore get unemploymen t allowance, training opportunities, counselling and "
other benefits offered by Unemployment Insurance Fund.  
 
Employers can apply for service supporting the employment of recipients of international protection 
"for example a one -time mentorship payment, comp ensation of professional training and "

importance of the action day and helped to prepare for it . The workshops for teachers were realised 
in January and February 2022.  
 
1.4 Research and awareness raising  
"On April 28, 2022, the Girls’ Day and Boys’ Day action days were held nationwide. This is a nationwide "
"event of the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth to promote career "
"orientation free of gender stereotypes. Around 120,000 schoolchildren took part in the day of action, "
visiting companies and institutions that have previously been male - or female -dominated. Girls  
"gained insight into male -dominated occupational fields, such as skilled trades, while boys in "
"particular gained insight into social and healthcare jobs. More than 11,000 companies and "
institutions nationwide took part in the day of action.  
 
"Supported by the BMFSFJ, The ProQuote Medien initiative (initiative advocating gender equality in "
the media) regularly publishes studies on the share of women in journalistic power in Germany (see 
also 1.5).  
 
"The Federal Association of Directors (Bundesverband Regie e.V., BVR) publishes an annual diversity "
"report, also with the support of the BMFSFJ. The most recent 7th Diversity Report for 2019 and 2020, "
"which was published in 2022, contains a gender analysis regarding the method to award contracts "
"to directors in Ge rman prime -time fiction programmes of the TV stations ARD, ZDF, RTL, SAT.1, Pro7, "
VOX and of streaming providers and in the German cinema industry.  
 
1.5 Other pertinent developments  
"The declaration “Joint action against sexism and sexual harassment”, whi ch was launched with "
important partners such as the Confederation of German Employers’ Associations (BDA) and the 
Association of German Cities (Deutscher Städtetag) with Federal Minister Lambrecht in October 
"2021, in the meantime encompasses far more than 300 – to some extent high -ranking – signatories "
"from business, public sphere, culture and media as well as civil society, and thus represents a unique "
"network, please see https://www.dialogforen -gegen -sexismus.de/gemeinsame -erklaerung -gegen -"
sexismus . 
 
"The joint declaration is the outcome of the “Dialogue Forums against Sexism”, in which more than "
"60 organisations from business, government, media and civil society have discussed and compiled "
"effective measures against sexism in the world of work, culture and media, and the public sphere. "
The measures have been published in the booklet titled “Together against Sexism” since June 2021 
"and have been circulated and diss eminated ever since, for instance by drawing people’s attention "
to it in newsletters and by conducting targeted forums.  
 
118 
 The European Academy for Women in Politics and Business (EAF Berlin) is the project partner.  
 
The coalition agreement for the 20th legislative term provides for the following: “We want a strong 
alliance against sexism”. The declaration and the dialogue forums serve as a basis for establishing 
such an effective nationwide alliance.  
 
Pinkstinks  
Pinkstinks is a protest and educational or ganisation against sexism and homophobia. Pinkstinks 
criticises gender stereotypes in media and advertising and shows alternatives for more diversity. The 
"Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth (BMFSFJ) provides funding to "
an online platform called “School against Sexism” (Schule gegen Sexismus) which is run by Pinkstinks. 
"This school aims at promoting media participation in discussions about sexism, gender and sexist "
"discrimination as well as preventing and combating sexism, sexual violence, harassment and "
discrimination by providing educational media services. Humorous and funny content is primarily 
disseminated via social media channels.  
 
ProQuote Medien (ProQuota Media)  
"With the support of the BMFSFJ the ProQuote Medien (PQ M) initiative, which was founded in 2012, "
draws public attention to the low rate of women in leadership positions in the media sector. The 
"association regularly takes a stand on current issues of women’s politics, produces the podcast series "
"”Macht’s gleic h” (Do it equally), hosts an annual expert conference and provides networking "
"opportunities for its members. Furthermore, PQM regularly publishes studies on the share of "
women publishers in Germany (please also see 1.4).  
 
ProQuote Bühne (ProQuota Stage)  
The initiative ProQuote Bühne is a group of stage directors and other creative minds in the world of 
theatre in Germany that campaigns for equal representation. It calls for a 50% share of women in all 
"artistic theatric fields. Numerous people from the arts,  politics, media and society support them in "
their concern. The BMFSFJ has funded the series of events titled “BE:COME VISIBLE” at Volksbühne 
Berlin where macrosocial and sector -specific deficits have been made visible and also synergy -
creating networking by stakeholders in this field has taken place.  
 
Power to transform  
"The initiative titled “Power to transform”, supported by the BMFSFJ, carried out brief morning online "
events where expert knowledge on the topic of sexism and media was conveyed in an enter taining 
"way. The various topics and best practice examples were presented by different researchers, "
journalists and authors. Various podcasts on the topic of sexism and discrimination were part of the 
"series just like a periodic newsletter containing infor mation on political developments, bills, current "
"events, etc.  "
 
The project “Neue Bilder braucht das Land” by the German Association of Women Journalists  
The project “Neue Bilder braucht das Land – für eine geschlechtergerechte Bildsprache” (Our 
country nee ds new images – for a gender -responsive visual language) will still be launched in 2022 
with the support of the BMFSFJ. The project seeks to spread gender -fair footage and moving images 
via an Instagram channel and at expert conferences. Gender -fair imagin g within the context of 
"journalistic reporting, on the one hand, aims at mapping societal diversity in its variety as realistically "
"and as free from prejudice as possible and on the other hand, at making it visible and deconstructing "
visual stereotypes and  redefining them in terms of gender sensitivity. The aim is to develop practical 
guidance on a gender -sensitive handling of images and videos for journalists.  
 
  
119 
 2. Strategic objective: Prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence  
 
2.4 Research and awareness raising  
"The Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth commissioned a new "
study on “Violence against Women with Disabilities in all sheltered workshops”. The three -year 
study has been launched in July  2021.  
 
The BMFSFJ continues to provide funding for the German NGO Network against Trafficking in Human 
"Beings (KOK). As a network of 42 organisations, including specialised advice centres for victims of "
"human trafficking, the KOK supports the work of its members,  represents their interests and "
"expertise in national and European political discourse, engages in prevention and sensitisation "
"measures, and implements research on various aspects of the phenomenon of human trafficking.  "
 
"In October 2021, the KOK publishe d its second report on data collection in the context of trafficking "
in human beings and exploitation in Germany. The report contains a first evaluation of the KOK data 
tool with over 700 cases of human trafficking and exploitation that have been registere d at 
specialised counselling centres. While the data compiled in the annual situation report on trafficking 
and exploitation published by the Federal criminal police office focuses on cases of human trafficking 
"that have entailed a criminal investigation, the data compiled in the report published by the KOK "
focuses on those cases that have been registered at specialised counselling centres – including those 
"where no criminal investigation was conducted. In comparison, the two reports show clear "
discrepancie s – for example with regard to the main countries of origin of the victims - which implies 
that specialised counselling centres are in touch with and have knowledge of cases that are not 
directly visible to the authorities. This underlines the important ro le of the data available to civil 
society organisations in drawing a clear picture of the phenomenon of human trafficking and the 
impact of measures aimed at combatting human trafficking in Germany. The KOK report is available 
online in English: https://www.kok -gegen -menschenhandel.de/en/news/kok -news/new -kok-
report -on-human -trafficking -and-exploitation -in-germany -bundles -data -from -specialised -
counselling -centres -for-the-first-time  .  
 
"From August -December 2022, the BMFSFJ provides funding for a special project by the KOK aimed "
at ensuring continued prevention and protection for refugees from Ukraine. The KOK will produce 
various best -practice publications and recommendations for policy makers and practitioners and will 
engage in intensified measures to sensitise volunteers working with refugees. The challenges linked 
to the goal of ensuring prevention and protection from human trafficking for persons fleeing the 
Ukraine will continue to be a point of major concern for all actors involved.  
 
3. Strategic objective: Ensure the equal access of women to j ustice  
 
3.1 Legislative changes  
There have been no pertinent legislative changes in the relevant reporting period nor are such 
changes planned. Equal access of women to judicial legal protection is guaranteed in German 
procedural law without discrimination.  
 
"Under German criminal procedural law, an accused may avail him - or herself of the assistance of "
"defence counsel at any stage of the proceedings irrespective of gender. Moreover, all the accused "
have equal access to court -appointed defence counsel in those cases in which this is deemed 
mandatory under national law with respect to the interests of justice.  
 
"However, in light of the presumption of innocence, the requirements with respect to the burden of "
"proof must remain high in criminal pro cedural law. Moreover, groups and civil society organisations "
that are not potential victims cannot become parties to criminal proceedings. Such a participation is 
alien to German law of criminal procedure and it potentially bears the danger to compromise the 
"rights of the accused. Victims, on the other hand, have the right to join the proceedings as a private "
120 
" accessory prosecutor where the accusation concerns certain unlawful acts, such as serious violent "
offences or - in case the accusation concerns other  offences - where it is for specific reasons deemed 
"necessary to safeguard the victim´s interests. Moreover, in order to ensure a high level of quality, "
"victims can make use of legal assistance, and victim protection organisations are free to accompany "
victims in proceedings.  
 
3.3 Institutional changes  
"The percentage of women is still growing in all parts of justice, from passed exams to lawyers, "
prosecutors and judges. In 2020 about 48% of judges and 51% of prosecutors were women; while 
"only 35% of the lawyers. On the other hand, at the same time more than 55% of the students who "
passed their second state exam were women. This can be expected to be reflected in a further 
"increase of the percentage of females in the numbers of lawyers, prosecutors and jud ges in the next "
years.  
(data for the period 2021 and 2022 are currently not available)  
 
3.5 Other pertinent developments . 
"The German Ministry of Justice is planning a symposium for October 2022, addressing the "
implications of psychotherapy for a victim´s  credibility in court. The interaction of therapy and 
credibility is particularly important in cases of crimes against sexual self -determination where the 
victim might urgently need therapeutical assistance and at the same time the victim´s statement is 
the only proof available.  
 
4. Strategic objective: Achieve balanced participation of women and men in political and public 
decision -making  
 
4.1 Legislative changes  
"On 16 March 2022, the German Bundestag, on request of the parliamentary groups of SPD, Alliance "
90/The Greens and FDP (20/1023) decided to set up a commission to reform electoral law and 
modernise parliamentary work.  
 
"In particular, it is the task of the commission to deal with measures to effectively make the "
"Bundestag smaller, aiming at achieving the legal standard size. Moreover, the commission is to draft "
"recommendations, among others to achieve a balanced representation of women and men in the "
"German Bundestag. On 30 August, an interim report was presented stating that in the second half "
"of 2022, the commission would again deal with the low percentage of women in parliament and with "
proposals in line with the constitution to ensure a balanced represent ation.  
 
4.2 Policy changes   
EAF “Action Programme Municipality –Women into Politics”  
"Since mid -2021, in close co -ordination with the German Countrywomen’s Association (Deutscher "
"Landfrauenverband (dlv)), the European Academy for Women in Politics and Business (EAF Berlin) "
has conducted an action programme aiming at sustainably increasing the share of women in local 
"representations (municipal, town, county councils) as well as the share of paid and voluntary female "
mayors and female heads of district au thorities. It focuses not only on women but also aims at 
contributing to initiating structural changes that can have a positive effect on the participation of 
women and the acceptance and attractiveness of local politics as a whole. The overarching objecti ve 
is to win and support women in predominantly rural regions as the current share of women in local 
councils and parliaments in Germany is only 27% on average. Among mayors the share of women is 
only 9%.  
 
During the term of four years in total there will be two programme runs with ten selected regions 
"per run. Interested regions (e.g., one or two districts or a district in co -operation with cities that do "
not form part of a district) can apply and will be selected by an expert body – under the auspices of 
121 
" the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth (BMFSFJ). The BMFSFJ will "
"provide funding of 1.7 million Euro to the action programme until December 2024, which amounts "
"to up to 500,000 Euro per year.  "
 
The German Association of T owns and Municipalities is another important co -operation partner. The 
"BMFSFJ works with the association mainly when it comes to recruiting, supporting and networking "
"female mayors. In September 2022, the second nationwide women’s congress took place focus ing "
primarily on female mayors and their deputies. The event served to encourage more women to take 
"up decision -making positions in politics, to help them become networked and to increase the "
"visibility of the many active women who are already working with  dedication to make their cities, "
towns and municipalities better places to live. This congress was organised jointly by the German 
"Association of Cities and Municipalities, the Lower Saxony Association of Cities and Municipalities, "
"the Lower Saxony Associ ation of Cities and Towns, EAF Berlin (European Academy for Women in "
"Politics and Business) and the German Countrywomen’s Association, with the support of the BMFSFJ.  "
 
4.3 Institutional changes .  
"The Federal Act on Appointment to Bodies (Bundesgremienbesetzungsgesetz, BGremBG) of 2015 "
was revised with the entry into force of the Act to Expand and Modify the Regulations for the Equal 
Participation of Women and Men in Leadership Positions in the Priv ate and Public Sectors (FüPoG II) 
on 12 August 2021. The aim of the act is to promote the equal participation of women and men in 
bodies to which the Federal Government may appoint members. The revised provisions apply to all 
supervisory bodies and main bo dies to which the Federal Government appoints two or more 
"members. The Federal Government has to meet the parity requirement for its 2,712 members in a "
total of 586 bodies.  
 
"Every year as of 31 December, the federal institutions record the composition of the boards and "
"report it to the Federal Statistical Office, which prepares overall body statistics on behalf of the "
"Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth.  "
 
The statistics are included in the annual information provided by t he Federal Government on the 
development of the share of women and men in executive positions and private and public sector 
bodies. The sixth annual information will be published this year and provide details on the 
composition of the main and supervisory bodies as of 31 December 2020 and on the changes 
compared with 31 December 2019.  
 
"Since the first board statistics were published as of 31 December 2017, there has been a very "
satisfactory development in the proportion of women among the members appointed  by the federal 
government to boards to which the provisions of the BGremBG apply.  
 
As of 31 Dec. 2017  42.4%  
As of 31 Dec. 2018  45.4%  
As of 31 Dec. 2019  46.4%  
As of 31 Dec. 2020  48.1%.  
 
The aim of achieving gender parity within these boards is within  realistic reach.

 4.4 Research and awareness raising  
Helene Weber College  
The increase of the number of women in parliaments is the objective of the Helen Weber College 
"(HWK) which is funded by the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth. "
The provider of the project by the HWK is the European Academ y for Women in Politics and 
Economy Berlin e.V. (EAF).  
 
Current examples:  
 
1. Helene Weber Award  
With the Helene Weber Award - awarded four times so far (last on 8 September 2020) - 
extraordinary local policymakers are honoured for their achievements. The prize is associated with 
"concrete funding for each and every prize winner. In addition to awarding 10,000 euros in prize "
"money to the main prize winner, all prize winners receive individual coaching to help them advance "
their political career as well as tr aining and support in building their network. The prize winners are 
role models in the HWK and at the same time ambassadors in favour of increasing the number of 
women in local politics. The Helene Weber Prize for 2024 is currently in preparation.

"alliance Ruhr (alliance between the University of Duisburg -Essen, Ruhr University Bochum and TU "
"Dortmund Un iversity) and the cities of Bochum, Dortmund and Essen politically interested and "
committed female students are familiarised with local policy structures and shown possibilities to 
participate and make a change. Those female students get motivation and sup port for their political 
commitment at local level.  
 
3. “Diversity in Politics!” mentoring programme  
"People with a migrant background account for 26% of the German population, but they are "
"significantly underrepresented at all levels of politics. However, especially women with a migrant "
background can contribute to a diverse party landscape and act as important role models. The 
"“Diversity in Politics” mentoring programme is funded by the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, "
"Senior Citizens, Women and Youth and is conducted for the second time in autumn 2021 by the EAF "
Berlin. The programme supports women with a migrant background on their path to achieve a 
political mandate and aims at actively and sustainably promoting diversity at all political levels.  
 
"5. Strategic objective: Protect the rights of migrant, refugee and asylum -seeking women and girls  "
 
5.4 Research and awareness raising . 
"With the federal initiative “Refugee Protection in Accommodation Centres”, the Federal Ministry for "
"Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth, together with UNICEF and a broad alliance of "
"partner organisations, has been working to protect women, chi ldren and other vulnerable people in "
refugee accommodation centres. The initiative’s main objective is to establish effective violence 
"prevention plans for those affected by violence. To this end, the members of the federal initiative "
"issued uniform nation wide “minimum standards for the protection of children, adolescents and "
women in refugee accommodation centres” in 2016. These standards contain guidelines for 
"preparing, implementing and monitoring centre -specific prevention plans. The guidelines are "
revised on a regular basis to take current practical experience into account. The “minimum 
standards” were last updated in 2021 in their 4th edition taking account of new legal provisions and 
current political developments. The federal initiative “Protection o f Refugees in Refugee 
Accommodation Centres” supports a variety of projects in the 2021/2022 funding period to support 
the implementation of the minimum standards and to support the obligation to prevent violence in 
refugee accommodation centres as set out  in the German Asylum Act since 2019 (see section 44 
(2a) and section 53 (3) of the Asylum Act). These projects include a pilot project to develop and test 
concepts for identifying particular vulnerabilities in refugee shelters (e.g. Identifying refugees 
123 
 affected by human trafficking) and a project to improve access to child and youth services for 
refugee families in shelters.  
 
6. Strategic objective: Achieve gender mainstreaming in all policies and measures  
 
6.2 Policy changes  
The implementation status of the cross -departmental gender equality strategy has been surveyed. 
The concept for an update is work in progress.  
 
"The Federal Government has updated the handbook for impact assessments of gender equality, "
implemented it in th e electronic legislative workflow and notified all ministries to use the revised 
handbook. The Federal Government has been commissioned to develop a gender equality check and 
intends to enforce the universal application of gender impact assessment through support and 
monitoring.  
 
6.3 Institutional changes  
The “Bundesstiftung Gleichstellung” (Federal Foundation for Gender Equality) is in an establishment 
"phase: Employees have been hired, a property was found and the network of partners and interested "
people grows continuously.  
 
6.4 Research and awareness raising  
"Research on the practical implementation, capacity building and enforcement of impact "
assessments of gender equality is currently being funded.  
 
6.5 Other pertinent developments  
"Gender Mainstreaming is mandatory for all political, legislative and non -legislative measures. The "
"government handbook for impact assessments of gender equality has been revised and published, "
accompanied by notification of all ministries.  
 
7. Main challenges an d lessons learned  
 
 
To reach as many people as possible to recognise the importance of taking action to combat gender 
"stereotypes (regarding points 1.3 and 1.4), it is important to raise awareness of this issue as widely "
"as possible. In a pandemic, for e xample, this awareness work can be carried out also via digital "
workshops that are specifically addressed to teachers and companies as well as institutions.  
 
"8. Additional comments, if any  "
 
 
Our Ministry (Division 414) would like to engage in a dialogue  with other member states with 
experience in this area to set up an alliance against sexism and sexual harassment.

 Hungary  
 
1. Strategic objective: Prevent and combat gender stereotypes and sexism  
 
1.1 Legislative changes  
"As provided for in Article XV (2) and (3) of the Fundamental Law of Hungary, the Hungarian "
substantive and procedural criminal law and the jurispr udence developed on the basis of it ensure 
the consistent prosecution and sanctioning of crimes against women. Women involved in criminal 
"proceedings are entitled without discrimination to all the rights, including the right to appeal against "
"decisions of authorities, which the law guarantees them in their actual status in criminal "
proceedings.  
 
"Between November 2021 and December 2022, no legislative changes were made in relation to the "
prohibition of sexist acts or the criminalisation of sexist hate speec h. There were no essential 
changes in the case law on gender -based offences. The system of legal remedies for victims of such 
acts has remained unchanged.  
 
1.2 Policy changes  
Pursuant to Section 5 (2) of Instruction No. 27/2013 (Xll. 21.) LU on equal opportunities (hereinafter: 
"Ut.), the Prosecutor General shall appoint an equal opportunities officer, who, in case the principle "
"of equal treatment is infringed, shall be obliged to take the measures provided for in the Ut. In the "
"reporting period, between November 2021 and 2022, the designated Equal Opportunities Officer "
(currently the Head of Division for Administrative and Environment Protection Cases at the 
Department for the P rotection of Public Interest of the Office of the Prosecutor General) was not 
approached by any prosecution employee for an infringement of the Ut.  
 
"According to Section 6 a) and b) of the Ut., the equal opportunities officer shall annually review the "
com pliance with the provisions of Section 4 of the Ut. governing the employer's measures promoting 
equal opportunities and shall submit an equal opportunities report to the Prosecutor General by 31 
March.  
 
The equal opportunities report prepared by the equal  opportunities officer for the year 2021 states 
that the persons exercising the employer's powers have taken into account the requirements of Act 
CXXV of 2003 on equal treatment and the promotion of equal opportunities as well as requirements 
"of the Ut., a nd the implementation of equal opportunities was promoted by employer measures "
"provided for in Section 4 of the Ut. For example, in 2021, a number of prosecution employees who "
were on unpaid maternity or childcare leave participated in training courses ini tiated by the 
employees themselves to provide them with the professional skills necessary for their job.  
 
2. Strategic objective: Prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence  
 
2.1 Legislative changes  
Shortly before the start of the reporting period - on 8 July 2Q21 - Act LXXIX of 2021 on stricter actions 
against paedophile offenders and amending certain acts to protect children entered into force. As a 
"result of the amendment, any person who has been se ntenced to an executable term of "
imprisonment for a violent crime committed against his or her family member and punishable by 
imprisonment of eight years or more may not be released on parole under Article 38(5) of Act C of 
2012 on the Criminal Code (here inafter: CC).  
 
"In the reporting period, the amendment to the law has led to a tightening of case law, in line with "
the legislator's intention.  
 
132 
 Chapter XIV of Act XC of 2017 on Criminal Procedure Code (hereinafter: CPC) provides a wide range 
of possibilities to reduce and eliminate the burden and possible risks of participation in the 
"procedure for persons requiring special treatment. Pursuant to Article 82 c) of the CPC, a victim of a "
"crime against sexual freedom and sexual offences, who is typically a woman, is considered a person "
requiring special treatment without a special decision. The Office of the Prosecutor General has 
issued several gener al guidelines for the Prosecution Service in relation to trafficking in human 
"beings, which is most often committed against women.  "
 
"When applying the law, prosecutors constantly monitor investigations supervised/controlled by "
"them, including investigation s into crimes committed against women, and within the framework of "
"such monitoring they take measures justified by the particularities of the given case, including the "
choosing of the type and extent of the legal sanctions.  
 
Act CVIII of 2020 on the revis ion of certain laws to increase the protection of victims of violent crimes 
"committed against family members, modified, inter alia, Act CCXL of 2013 on the execution of "
"punishments, criminal measures, certain coercive measures and confinement for administr ative "
"offences as of 5 November 2020, Section 188 (2a) c) of which sets forth as a requirement that for "
"the initiation of parole, the opinion of the guardianship authority needs to be obtained regarding "
the convict's minor aged child.  
 
"For the execution o f the legal provisions, Government Decree 10/2021. (I. 20.) on the modification "
of certain government decrees regulating child protection issues (hereinafter: “Mód.r.”) enacted 
"Section 9/A of Government Decree 149/1997. (lX. 10.) on guardianship authoritie s, child protection "
and guardianship procedures (hereinafter: “Gyer”). This Section has been effective as of 23 January 
2021 and provides for the guardianship authority's opinion made to protect the convict's minor -aged 
child.  
 
"Furthermore, Mód.r. supplem ented Section 27 (4b) of Gyer, which stipulates that no institutions "
responsible for children's protection and welfare should be designated as places for the exercise of 
supervised parents' visitation rights which are covered by the scope of the restrainin g order issued 
"by the court as a coercive measure in accordance with Section 280 of CPC, or which are covered by "
the scope or the restraining order issued by the court or the prosecutor in accordance with Section 
"71 (2) b) of the CC. Pursuant to Section 27  (4c) of Gyer, which is also a supplemented legal provision, "
upon proposal of the service provider that ensures the appropriate exercise of supervised parents' 
"visitation rights, the guardianship authority reviews the exercise of the supervised parents' vi sitation "
"rights. As a result of that review, to protect the interests of the child, the guardianship authority can "
"decide, inter alia, to restrict, revoke the visitation rights or to change the location where the right "
can be exercised.  
 
"According to Sect ion 4 (184) of Act V of 2013 on the Civil Code, in the interest of the child the "
guardianship authority or - in a lawsuit for the settlement of marital or parental custody - the court 
may restrict or revoke the visitation rights of the parent or other pers ons who are entitled to such 
rights and commit wrongful acts imputable to them.  
 
"In view of the above -mentioned provisions, based on its power to initiate proceedings according to "
Section 5 (1) of Act CLXIII of 2011 on the Prosecution Service (hereinafter: Ütv.) the administrative 
professional branch of the Prosecution Service can initiate the restriction or revocation of parents' 
visitation rights at the guardianship authority.  
 
"In connection with the Hungarian judicial system, it is important  to mention that the enforcement "
of resolutions relating to visitation rights may be initiated at the court with jurisdiction over the place 
of residence of the child instead of the guardianship authority as of 1 March 2020.Under the co -
"ordination of the N ational Office for the Judiciary (from herein: NOJ), judges and court staff started "
133 
 preparing for the transition and to provide high -quality service to justice -seeking citizens after the 
law had come into force.  
 
"Compared to the previous proceedings, the a pplication – to be filed with the court – is more detailed "
"and precise: it must include personal information of the custodial and non -custodial parent, the "
"child, the name of the court or guardianship authority that regulated the visitation, the number of "
"the case file, a description of what was in breach of the rules of visitation and a request for enforcing "
the resolution.  
 
"Considering the circumstances of the case and the best interest of the child, the court may apply "
several sanctions against the perso n who breached the rules of visitation. They may turn to the 
"guardian authority to facilitate compliance with the rules of visitation, but they may also request to "
"change the rights of custody or place the child with a third party. In addition, the court m ay impose "
"fines; and in the case of a recurring, serious breach of the rules, they may request assistance from "
the police at the time of delivery of the child. They may file a report for endangering a minor or 
obstructing the visitation.  
 
2.2 Policy changes  
"The extended care system for victims of domestic violence and trafficking in human beings, which "
"has been expanded in recent years, has provided assistance in a number of cases, through telephone "
"counselling, placement in crisis centres or in secr et shelters, and social reintegration of victims of "
domestic violence. Policy developments for the coming years were planned during the reporting 
period.  
 
"The priority for the coming period is prevention, including both variants. The policy aims to prevent  "
victimisation through primary prevention and to help as many people as possible who have already 
"shown signs of violence in their relationships and family relations but are not yet in crisis, through "
secondary prevention.  
 
"To this end, the aim is to make  the services of the crisis management clinics even more widely "
"available: by strengthening the provision at the county level, the number of crisis management "
clinics for victims of domestic violence would increase from 7 to 22 (2 crisis management clinics  are 
expected to be opened in Budapest). The crisis management clinics will also have primary prevention 
functions in the future.  
 
"Also, as a preventive intervention, the training of the child protection signalling system will continue. "
"In the current development period (2021 -2027) another 5,000 people are being planned to be "
"trained, the target group will now mainly be teachers, kind ergarten teachers as well as early "
childhood educators.  
 
These complex developments are planned to be financed by EU development funds. The EFOP Plus 
Operational Programme is currently being discussed with the European Commission.  
 
"Within the framework of  the priority project of the Margit Slachta National Social Policy Institute, "
"the EFOP -1.9.4 -VEKOP -16-2016 -00001 project named ""Renewal of the methodological and "
"information systems of the social sector” the intersectoral working group, which was created t o "
make the operation of the warning system more efficient and to improve the co -operation of the 
"warning system members, started its operation on 1st February 2022. The operation of the working "
group covers the analysis of the detection and warning system activity created and provided for by 
Section 17 of Act XXXI of 1997 on the protection of children and guardianship administration and by 
Section 64 of Act III of 1993 on social administration and social benefits.  
 
"As a result of the working group's activi ties, professional material was prepared with title "
“lntersectoral co -operation in support of the detection and warning system” on the problems 
134 
" identified in the areas of detection, warnings and co -operation by the bodies participating in the "
"warning syste m, such as the Prosecution Service and representatives of various sectors, and the "
proposed solutions for their management. The material deals in a separate section with the 
operation of the detection and warning system in the case of domestic abuse and vi olence between 
"family members and relatives. According to our latest official knowledge, the completed professional "
material is awaiting ministerial approval.  
 
2.3 Institutional changes  
"The operation of the 5 new crisis centres, 7 secret shelters, 22 halfway houses and 7 crisis "
management clinics established in 2018 -2019 with EU development funds will be covered by the 
"national central budget from 2022 onwards, with the same level of funding as the EU grant. The "
resources needed to maintain the expande d care system are included in the national central budget 
"as a base, which means that they will be provided year by year.  "
 
Child -centred justice guarantees the effective implementation of the rights of children at the highest 
"level, ensuring age -appropriat e treatment and the best interests of the child in all cases involving or "
"affecting them, while providing the judges working with children in legal proceedings with "
"appropriate training. Concerning the above -described objectives, as of 20 May 2020, the Pre sident "
of NOJ has been assisted by the Department on the rights of children to develop the necessary 
regulations which are in line with the child -friendly justice guidelines by the Committee of Ministers 
of the Council of Europe.  
 
2.4 Research and awarene ss raising  
"In 2021, on the International Day of Violence Against Women, the Hungarian police published a post "
on the police's official Instagram page with the title “Not your fault”.  
 
A methodological guide has been prepared to assist in the preparation and content of prevention 
programmes targeting young people on the issue of human trafficking.  
 
"The summary study of a 2021 research was prepared, which examined the life paths of victims of "
human trafficking in Hungary and the professional work of the car e system assisting and supporting 
them.  
 
"The campaign ""Love doesn’t hurt!"" was continued. The state provided HUF 30 million for the period "
from 01.08.2021 to 30.06.2022 in terms of the implementation of this campaign. The main objective 
of the campaign was  to emphasise that there are places where victims of domestic violence can turn 
to for help. The campaign also raised awareness of how anyone can offer support and help as a 
"layperson when they encounter a victim of domestic violence. In parallel, the camp aign shared "
"knowledge through a number of channels, the most successful being a series of commercials based "
"on real -life cases, showing a side of domestic violence, which aimed to raise awareness and help "
victims realise that the abuse they are suffering i s not acceptable.  
 
"A large -scale, nationally representative survey on domestic violence is underway. The current phase "
of the research seeks to map the current extent of involvement and how it has changed in recent 
years.  
 
  
135 
 2.5 Other pertinent developme nts  
In terms of the Government's action plan for the years 2022 -2023 [Governmental Decree 
1228/2022 (IV. 14.) on the action plan for the period 2022 -2023 for the implementation of the

proof in order to ensure the fair management and handling of cases related to women.  
 
There is no discernible case of discrimination against women in case law.  
 
3.2 Policy changes  
The NOJ does not have statistical data regarding this question.  
 
3.3 Institutional changes  
"In connection with the Hungarian judicial system, it is important to mention that the courts "
"established and implemented witness support, which operates as a national programme from 2013 "
"onwards. In 2015, the programme was complemented with victim protection, as victims are usually "
questioned as witnesses during the proceedings.  
 
"In 2015, witness care was not only present among the programmes and strategic goals of the NOJ "
but also appeared as one of the services to be provided by the state to the victim after assessment 
of and adjusted to his/her needs set out in Act CXXXV of 2005 on Helping the V ictims of Crimes and 
the Mitigation of Damages by the State (hereinafter referred to as: ‘Victim Care Act’).  
 
"Pursuant to Section 4(5) of the Victim Care Act, a witness summoned to a court hearing may turn to "
a court victim care representative in order to request appropriate information. The court victim care 
representative is an administrator of the court who provides information in the manner set out in a 
separate legal act in order to facilitate the giving of testimony and the appearance at the court of 
necessary to this end. This act raised the institution of witness care to the level of laws and named 
"it as one of the services to be provided by the state, however the courts had – supporting the "
strategic goals of the President of the NOJ – already made significant efforts prior to that in order to 
effectively ensure the enforcement of the rights of witnesses and victims and to facilitate the 
performance without fear of the obligation to bear witness. The facilitation of the obligation to bear 
witness als o promotes the timeliness of the administration of justice.  
 
"Lack of information, the unknown generates fear in clients, consequently the national programme "
focuses on providing wide -range easily comprehensible information to witnesses regarding their 
"proc edural rights and options, facilitating the enforcement of their rights, including their rights as "
"victims, without prejudice to impartiality, and facilitating that the witnesses can give testimony "
without fear.  
 
"One element of the sensitive treatment of w itnesses is that whenever possible, the courts ensure "
that the witness can wait and be interviewed at a location separated from the defendant and other 
participants of the proceedings.  
 
The judiciary organisation assists in the fulfilment of the obligatio n to bear witness also by striving 
"to provide easily comprehensible and accurate information in the widest scope possible, such as in "
"the summons, websites, customer orientation materials and any posters, media representations and "
136 
" social networks. In most cases, this wide -range information covers not only the presentation of rights "
and obligations but also provides practical information to the witnesses.  
 
"In addition, it is also our aim to ensure that victims receive professional help that is appropriate t o "
"their situation, which requires an information network via which the court employees can refer the "
victim to the appropriate body. It is not only the regional courts that are committed to the 
"establishment of the victim protection network but also the NO J, and therefore the NOJ is striving "
to establish close co -operation with the National Police Headquarters and the partner organisations 
of the child protection network.  
 
3.4 Research and awareness raising  
"Between 2018 – 2022, there were numerous judicial training sessions held concerning topics on "
"family law, non -discrimination – equal treatment, victim protection and asylum. 49 of these training "
"sessions were international, organised by different organisations (e.g., EJTN, ERA). Others were "
eithe r central organised by the NOJ (36 training sessions) or regional (53 training sessions).  
 
In the prosecutorial training and further training programme adopted by the Prosecutor General 
"every year, we pay special attention to compliance with the various EU  directives and planned "
"strategies, thus, to ensure equal access to enforce gender equality.  "
 
"There is no discrimination of any kind, not even gender -based discrimination in the Prosecution "
"Service of Hungary or in the training sessions, as in 2021, for ex ample, we announced two calls for "
"applications for trainee prosecutors, as a result of which the Prosecutor General appointed 52 "
"trainee prosecutors. Out of the 52 persons, the gender ratio is 27 women and 25 men. Both trainees "
"and later on prosecutors are  trained in the same way, regardless of sex, and although there is no "
"exact data about the ratio, considering that there are more female employees in the organisation, "
"the proportion of women participating in training is probably higher out of the approx. 2,500 people "
trained annually.  
 
"In our training sessions, we also lay special emphasis on victim protection – which affects women in "
addition to children the most.  
 
"During the 4 -day long training of junior prosecutors, we regularly organise lectures with t itles "
“Victims of Human trafficking” and “The classification of human trafficking and the identification of 
"its victims”, but victim protection is given high emphasis specifically in the area of human trafficking "
itself. Just as crimes against sexual freed om and sexual morality are regularly recurring topics in our 
various training courses.  
 
"5. Strategic objective: Protect the rights of migrant, refugee and asylum -seeking women and girls  "
 
5.1 Legislative changes  
The Hungarian asylum legislation fully complies with the requirement of gender equality.  
 
The asylum authority examines the circumstances of the person concerned individually in 
"connection with each decision. As a result of this examination and data comparison, an individual "
"decision is made, i n which the applicant's sex does not play a role.  "
 
5.2 Policy changes  
"As a neighbouring country, many people fled to Hungary to escape the war in Ukraine. Almost "
"immediately, recruiters and pimps appeared at the border crossings. The Family Affairs "
"Departments, in co -operation with the Ministry of Interior, distributed 250,0 00 bilingual (Hungarian "
and Ukrainian) leaflets at the border and at major railway stations and airport in the capital. The 
leaflets contain practical information on how to reduce the risk of becoming a victim of trafficking. 
137 
 Large posters with the same co ntent as the leaflets also help to inform individuals crossing the 
border. The information material also provides contact details of the organisation providing 
assistance.

Day care of children  
"During the 2021 -2022 waves of Covid -19, nursery care settings continued to operate, with "
temporary on -site closures of facilities and services only in the event of specific epidemiological 
measures (closure of a setting or gro up). The legal provisions allowing workplace childcare services 
during the emergency were in force until 31 May of 2022.  
 
It is important for families with young children to be able to plan their long -term return to the labour 
market from the moment they h ave children. The complex development of nursery care with EU and 
"national funding, which also has an impact on the growth of female employment, continued during "
the reference period of the report. The reform of the nursery care network is being implemente d 
"with the planned use of RRF, TOP Plus, EFOP Plus, DIMOP Plus and national funds, among others. "
The aim of the improvements is to expand the conditions for early childhood education in order to 
reduce social inequalities and increase employment prospects for parents.  
 
"Within the framework of the nursery development program, the Government has set the goal of "
implementing a network of nursery care settings in Hungary that responds to the needs of parents 
"who request it. As a result, compared to 2010, by July 2022, there were already 75% more places "
"providing nursery care. Additionally, care was provided in almost three times more settlements. "
"Accordingly, it makes care available to 20% of children under 3 years of age (in Hungary, 99,7% of "
"children in nur sery care are over 1 year old, so for their age group, the rate is already close to 30%).  "
 
"In the area of day -care provision for young children, the following relevant new proposals will "
contribute to the development of nursery care places (previous propos als are being fulfilled on 
schedule):  
 
"1. In 2021, the National Family nursery, Workplace nursery and Mini -nursery Development "
Programme for Non -Municipal Operators called for applications for the development of 
139 
" family nursery, workplace nursery services and mini nursery facilities. The tender was "
successful.  
2. The tender for the Development of Nursery Education under the Hungarian Recovery and 
Resilience Plan was launched on 12 November 2021 and was successfully closed.  
3. The call for proposals under the Human In frastructure Development in Support of Childcare 
"(TOP Plus) has been open for applications since December 2021, with different expiry and "
timing dates for each county (currently in several phases until the end of December 2022).  
"4. As a continuation of the Na tional Nursery Development Programme announced in 2018, "
municipalities were again able to submit applications for the development of nursery and 
mini nursery places from 18 March 2021 to 1 December 2021. A similar proposal opportunity 
"will be closed on Dec ember 30th of 2022, which was launched in December of 2021.  "
 
"In the 2022 central budget, the specific number of estimates and state subsidies/per unit norms for "
the operation of nursery care settings continued to increase.  
 
"The salaries of nursery profess ionals, who are over -represented by female employees, was further "
increased by an average of 20% from 1 January 2022 as part of a phased pay rise that has been in 
place since 2016.

consultation to give stakeholders and interested parties an opportunity to provide their views on 
the ratification by Ireland of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Violence and Harassment 
"Convention, 2019 (No. 190). Ireland is committed to proceeding to ratification a s quickly as possible, "
taking into account the need to ensure all necessary legislative and administrative requirements 
under the Convention are met. Government approval of a decision to ratify the Convention was 
"announced on 1 December, with the instrumen t of ratification to be submitted in January 2023.10 "
 
The Hate Crime and Hate Speech Bill 2022 was published by Government in October 2022 and is 
"proposed to introduce new, specific aggravated offences with enhanced penalties for crimes "
"motivated by prejudice against certain characteristics, including gender and sex characteristics "
(meaning all physical and biological features of a person relating to their sex ). This will mean that 
certain types of crimes can be prosecuted as hate crimes where they a re motivated by misogyny. 
The list of identity characteristics protected under the law was developed after extensive 
consultation and in line with best practice internationally. The Bill is currently before Parliament.11 
 
1.2 Policy changes  
"An updated statutory code of practice on Sexual Harassment and Harassment at Work, developed "

1.4 Research and awareness raising  
"In December 2021, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth published "
"the report, “Statistical Spotlight No. 6 – Gender Norms in Ireland”. With the publication of this "
"report, Ireland became the first country to apply the OECD ""Man Enough"" framework on gender "
norms to national data to measure norms of masculinities in society. The report provided the basis 
"for a webinar hosted by th e Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on 2 "
February 2022 on “Positive Gender Norms in Ireland”. The event featured a keynote presentation of 
"the Man Enough report and framework from the OECD Development Centre, along with a "
presentation of the Spotlight report. Panellists discussed where gender norms fit into the goals of 
"advancing sustainable development and wellbeing in society, and practical measures to encourage "
gender -equitable gender norms and counter restrictive gender norms. The discussion was captured 
in a report of the webinar commissioned from Maynooth University. The project was also featured 
in a side event co -hosted by Ireland with Colombia and the OECD Development Centre at UN CSW66 
on 16 March 2022. Ireland will  be presenting the Statistical Spotlight as an example of good practice 
on the role of men and boys in advancing gender equality and breaking stereotypes at a seminar to 
be co -hosted in Dublin in February 2023 with Austria and the EU Commission under the M utual

Amendments to provide for a new right to domestic violence leave were introduced to the Work Life 
Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2022 at Committee Stage in the Dáil on 8 November 2022. 
"The proposed leave is intended to prevent a victi m of domestic violence from losing employment, "
"putting them at risk of falling into poverty, and will allow a victim to find alternative accommodation, "
"seek help from An Garda Síochána or the Courts Service, or to obtain help from support "
"organisations. Th e leave can be taken immediately and flexibly, with no requirement for proof to be "
"produced by the person availing of the leave. The legislation, if enacted, will include a requirement "
to review its effectiveness after two years in order to ensure that it is providing the best support 
"possible to anyone experiencing domestic violence. The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, "
Integration and Youth is also commissioning supports for individual employers to develop their own

"underpin it.  The €363 million strategy is built on four pillars – Protecti on, Prevention, Prosecution "
and Policy Co -ordination – and the accompanying implementation plan contains 144 detailed actions 
"and new oversight structures. Its central aim is Zero Tolerance of domestic, sexual and gender -based "
violence in our society. The actions are drawn from across Government departments and State 
agencies to reflect the fact that Zero Tolerance can only be achieved through a whole of society 
"effort, and that domestic, sexual and gender -based violence cannot be treated as a criminal just ice "
issue alone. The Strategy also seeks to clearly identify children and young people as both witnesses

In December 2022 the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform published a report: Gender 
"Balance Diversity on State Boards - the next steps, which sets out achievements to date towards "
meeting the longstanding Government commitment to achieve a 40% representation of women and 
"of men on all State Boards. This report found that females represented 46.1% of the 2,610 members "
of the State Boards by the end of 2021 and 59% of boards were meeting the 40% target. The report 
"provides for a number of ac tions to encourage greater female participation on State boards, "
including measures relating to recruitment campaigns and information awareness raising on the 
work of a State Board.  
 
4.5 Other pertinent developments  
"In September 2022, the All -Island Wom en’s Forum published its first annual report for 2021 -2022 of "
findings and recommendations on key issues affecting women across the island of Ireland. The 
"Forum has made a number of recommendations to both governments, including developing an all -"
"island st rategy on gender -based violence, introducing gender quotas for local politics, and a North -"
South media partnership which would increase women’s voices on all -island issues.  
 
"The Forum represents a contribution by the National Women's Council, a civil society body, to the "
"Irish Government’s Shared Island initiative in the Department of an Taoiseach, and aims to enhance "
"civil society links and supporting engagement by women, across communities and traditions on the "
"island, on issues of common concern. Th e Forum is funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs "
Reconciliation Fund.24 
 
"5. Strategic objective: Protect the rights of migrant, refugee and asylum -seeking women and girls  "
 
5.2 Policy changes  
The Government made a commitment in the 2020 Programme for  Government to end the current 
system of accommodation for International Protection applicants and replace it with a new model 
"that is based on a not -for-profit approach. As part of this process, in February 2021 the Minister for "
"Children, Equality, Disabi lity, Integration and Youth published A White Paper to end Direct Provision "
and to Establish a new International Protection Support Service that set out a new approach for 
accommodating applicants that seek International Protection in Ireland and replacing  the current 
system.25 Progress to date includes: the development of the community accommodation model 
including the acquisition of some properties; the development of an integration programme to 
support the principle of ‘integration from day one’ as set ou t in the White Paper; the initiation of a 
planning process for Phase One Reception and Integration Centres; and the roll out of an integration 
"fund, offering grants to civil society organisations for projects supporting the integration of "
International Pro tection Applicants.  
 
The war in Ukraine and a substantial increase in the number of people seeking International 
Protection in Ireland has had an unavoidable impact on timelines for the implementation of the

6. Strategic objective: Achieve gender mainstreaming in all policies and measures  
 
6.1 Legislative changes   
In May 2022 Regulations were published under the Ge nder Pay Gap Information Act 2021 requiring 
both public and private sector employers with over 250 employees to publish information on the 
"mean and median hourly wage gap in their organisations overall, and for part -time and temporary "
"employees. Employers were also required to publish data on bonus pay, and on the proportions of "
"male and of female employees in the lower, lower middle, upper middle and upper quartile pay "
bands showing the extent to which men and women are represented at the various pay level s in the 
"firm. Employers are also obliged to publish a statement setting out, in the employers’ opinion, the "
reasons for any gender pay gaps in their organisation and what measures are being taken or 
proposed to be taken by the employer to eliminate or red uce that pay gap. The requirement will 
extend over time to organisations with 50 or more employees. Relevant employers were asked to 
"select a ‘snapshot’ date in June 2022 in which to base their reporting, and to report within six months "
of that date. The f irst reports were published by employers in December 2022.26 
 
"6.5 Other pertinent developments , "
Over the course of 2022 the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of 
"Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth continued to lead work on the cross -government "
"Equality Budgeting initiative, which has led to work to enhan ce the visibility and availability of "
"equality data, and to develop organisational capacity for gender and equality proofing to support "
equality mainstreaming and to implement the statutory Public Sector Equality and Human Rights 
Duty. 27 
 
"Following the ext ension of equality budgeting to all Government Departments in 2021, equality goals "
and metrics were requested in November 2022 for each individual budgetary programme for each 
Department under Budget 2023. The national Wellbeing Framework was also further refined in June 
2022 along with a pathway for embedding a well -being approach into policy making over time.28 
 
The expansion of equality budgeting and the statutory obligation on public bodies to take account 
of equality and human rights impacts in the perf ormance of their functions (i.e. the Public Sector 
Duty) are driving demand for equality data and for increased capacity in gender and equality 
proofing. Ireland was successful in its application to participate in the EU Commission's flagship 
"project, ""Gen der Mainstreaming in Public Policy and Budgeting”, under its 2022 Technical Support "
"Initiative programme. The project began in mid -2022 and is to run for two years, involving all "
participant countries in a first umbrella module focused on the concepts invo lved and exchange of 
"practice, followed by a second module tailored to each country’s requirements. The Irish "
workstream of this project is focused on strengthening gender and equality proofing in Ireland 
throughout the policy cycle and will run from mid -2022 to 2024. This will include piloting the 
preparation of gender and equality proofing action plans in 2 to 3 Government Departments and the 
development of a curriculum for capacity building in regard to gender and equality impact 
"assessment, mainstreamin g and budgeting. Ireland's workstream was formally launched in "
December 2022.  
 
"On 21 March 2022, to mark the International Day against Racism, the Minister for Children, Equality, "

"improving the collection, use and dissemination of equality data. A working group led by the Central "
"Statistics Office with policy support from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration "
"and Youth  has brought together a range of stakeholders from across Government, as well as civil "
"society and research bodies, to develop the Strategy. This builds on the Equality Data Audit published "
in 2020 by the Central Statistics Office on the initiative of the Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory 
Group.29 It is intended that the Strategy will be in place from 2023 and that it will provide a general 
"approach for identifying current gaps in Equality data and guidance on how to fill those gaps, as well "
as develop stan dard practices in classification.

1. Strategic objective: Prevent and combat gender stereotypes and sexism  
 
1.2 Policy changes  
"Within the framework of Mission 5 of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), investment "
"1.3 is devoted to the activation of a National Gender Equality Certification System, with the aim of "
incentivising companies to adopt appropriate policies to reduce the gender gap in all the most critical 
"areas, such as career opportunities, equal pay for equal work, gender  equality management policies "
and maternity protection.  
 
The intervention consists of the following three steps:  
"- definition of the system for gender equality certification and reward mechanism, starting with the "
establishment of a Working Group on “Gende r Certification of Companies” at the Department for 
Equal Opportunities;  
- creation of an information system for the collection of gender -disaggregated data and information 
"on certification, as well as the register of accredited bodies;  "
- activation of th e gender equality certification system as of the second quarter of 2022.  
 
The certification system will be open to all companies regardless of size requirements. In the pilot 
"phase - which will last until the second quarter of 2026 - certification will be facilitated for medium, "
"small and micro -sized enterprises, and accompanied by complementary assistance services.  "
 
1.3 Institutional changes  
"Through the Budget Law 2022, approved last December 2021, the National Strategy for Gender "
Equality 2021 -2026 has been enhanced through an ad hoc  governance consisting of an 
interinstitutional Steering Committee and a National Observatory for the integrati on of gender 
equality policies.  
 
The Steering Committee was established by Decree of 27 January 2022 and links different 
administrations involved in order to co -ordinate actions at a central and territorial level. Among its 
"tasks, the Steering Committee c arries out periodic assessment over the implementation of measures "
"and interventions provided for in the National Strategic Plan for Gender Equality, as well as ensures "
the planning of resources allocated to financing the Plan. The Steering Committee is ch aired by the 
Prime Minister or by the political authority in charge for equal opportunities and is composed of 20 
Ministers and 3 designated by the Unified Conference.  
 
"The National Observatory for the Integration of Gender Policies, established by the De cree of "
"22 February 2022, is a technical body supporting the Steering Committee, in order to monitoring, "
"analysing, studying and proposing possible tools for the definition and implementation of the "
"Strategy, evaluating its impact in order to improve its e ffectiveness and integrate its provisions and "
actions.  
 
1.4 Research and awareness raising  
By Decree of 22 April 2021 the Minister for Equal Opportunities and the Family set up a Working 
Group at the Department for Equal Opportunities on issues relating  to the rebalancing of gender 
"representation in institutions and the revision of appointment and election procedures, as well as to "
support the evaluation of measures introduced to protect equal opportunities.  
 
"The WG, composed of nine university professor s in the fields of constitutional law, public law and "
"comparative public law, was assigned the task of carrying out in -depth studies and drafting "
"proposals, including legislative ones, aimed at rebalancing gender representation in institutions and "
revising  appointment and election procedures.  
148 
  
The outcomes of the WG are provided in a Working Paper published on 1 December 2021.  
 
1.5 Other pertinent developments  
"The female presence in Public Service Broadcasting (RAI) programming is at 37%, at the bottom of  "
the European public service media rankings. Women are mainly called upon to represent and 
recount their personal experiences; much more rarely to show their expertise. Only 22.3% of the 
"experts in Public Service programmes are female. The 'No Women No Pan el' initiative, initiated by "
"the European Commission, was taken up in 2020 by Radio Rai Uno. Gradually, institutions and "
"organisations from all over Italy joined in, also receiving the endorsement of the Head of State. In "
"recent months, a Memorandum of Und erstanding has been drawn up committing the Public Service "
to include female and male speakers as equally as possible in the debates.  
 
Making the best skills and experience gained in public administration available to primary and 
secondary schools to train  students about respect for others and equal opportunities: this is the 
"goal of the 'PAri si cresce, 8 marzo in rete' project, which is based upon a MoU signed on 8 March "
"2021 between the Minister for Public Administration, the Minister for Equal Opportuni ties and the "
"Family, the Minister for Education, and the National Network of Guarantee Committees. It envisages "
that approximately 200 Guarantee Committees for equal opportunities set up in public 
"administrations (Ministries, Regions, local authorities, Lo cal Health Units, Universities, National "
"Agencies) by Legislative Decree No. 165/2001, strengthened by Directives 4 March 2011 and 2/2019 "
"and now brought together in the National Network - provide support, information and training to "
"develop cultural inter ventions in schools, in collaboration with school staff, aimed at fostering "
educational growth and respect education against all forms of discrimination.  
 
"As for the above mentioned gender certification system, the Decree of 29 April 2022 of the Minister "
"for Equal Opportunities - issued pursuant to Article 1, paragraph 147 of Law No. 234 of 30 November "
2021 (Budget Law 2022) - has implemented since 1 July 2022 the Guidelines on the Management 
System for Gender Equality that envisages the adoption of specifi c KPIs (Key Performance 
"Indicators) inherent to UNI/PdR 125:2022 Reference Practice, as minimum parameters for the "
achievement of gender equality certification for companies. This is an important step in the 
"establishment of the National System for the cer tification of gender equality in companies, as key "
"action of the NRRP under the Department for Equal Opportunities, which aims to accompany and "
incentivise companies to adopt appropriate policies to reduce the gender gap.  
 
2. Strategic objective: Prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence  
 
2.1 Legislative changes   
"Following the approval of Act No. 53 of 2022, the Italian Parliament has ruled the collection of data "
and information on gender -based violence against women in order to monitor the phenomenon and 
"develop policies to prevent and combat it. To this end, the law:  "
"- introduces the obligation for offices, bodies, organisations and public and private entities "
involved in official statistical information to provide data and information fo r compiling all 
"kind of surveys of the national statistical programme, as well as to collect, process and "
disseminate gender -disaggregated data;  
"- introduces an obligation for all public health facilities, and in particular first aid units, to "
provide data a nd news on violence against women;  
- establishes an integrated system between the Ministries of the Interior and of Justice for 
the collection of data concerning offences under the umbrella definition of violence against 
"women, with particular regard to thos e data that facilitate the conceptual relationship "
between the perpetrator and the victim of the offence;  
149 
 - provides that data concerning specific offences could be amended so that data concerning 
"the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim of the offence, their age and "
"gender, and the circumstances of the offence are recorded;  "
"- refines, by enriching them with additional information data, the annual surveys of ISTAT on "
the performance and services offered by anti -violence centres and shelters res pectively.  
 
"Furthermore, on 16 February 2022 a government bill (S. 2530) on 'provisions for preventing and "
combating the phenomenon of violence against women and domestic violence' was submitted in 
"the Italian Senate for debate. It provides for amendments to the Crimi nal Code, the Code of Criminal "
"Procedure, the Anti -Mafia Code (Legislative Decree No. 159/2011) and some special laws in order to "
make the system of measures to prevent and combat violence against women more effective. In 
particular it:  
- extends the applic ability of the Questore's warning for domestic violence to every conduct 
which puts at risk the psycho -physical integrity of persons in the context of family and 
emotional relationships. The penalties are also increased when the offence is committed by 
"a person who has already been cautioned, and proceedings are taken ex officio  for certain "
offences when committed by a person who has already been cautioned;  
- provides for the revocation of the precautionary measure and its replacement by custody 
in prison in the event of tampering with the electronic bracelet. In ordering the coercive 
"measure of removal from the family home using electronic means of control, the judge must "
"provide for the application, even jointly, of a more serious measure if the defendant re fuses "
to consent to the adoption of the electronic means of control. The same measure is 
provided for in the case of a prohibition to approach places frequented by the offended 
person;  
- it intervenes on the Anti -Mafia Code by extending the applicability of personal prevention 
measures to persons suspected of certain serious offences committed in the context of 
"gender -based violence and domestic violence and to persons who, having already been "
"warned by the Questore, are suspected of the crimes of assault, in jury, private violence, "
"aggravated threats, trespassing and damage, committed in the context of domestic "
violence;  
"- expands the catalogue of offences for which there is an obligation - on the part of the police, "
health authorities and public institutions th at receive information from the victim - to 
inform the victim about the anti -violence centres in the area and to put her or him in contact 
with these centres if she or he requests them;  
"- introduces an additional hypothesis of detention ordered by the Public  Prosecutor, by "
"reasoned decree, against the person seriously suspected of mistreatment against family "
"members, personal injuries and stalking;  "
- intervenes on the benefit of a suspended sentence for crimes of gender and domestic 
"violence, allowing the judge  to make use of external criminal enforcement offices to identify "
"the bodies or associations dealing with prevention, psychological assistance and recovery "
of persons convicted of crimes of domestic violence and gender violence and the specific 
recovery pa ths provided for them;  
- introduces the obligation to arrest the suspect in flagrante delicto  in the event of violation 
of protection orders adopted in civil law;  
"- provides that in proceedings for gender and domestic violence offences, the termination or "
"revocation of coercive precautionary measures, as well as their replacement with less "
"serious measures, are to be communicated to the Questore, for the purposes of assessing "
"its competence in the field of prevention measures, and to the Prefect for the purpos es of "
an eventual adoption of dynamic supervision measures to protect the offended person;  
"- introduces a provisional provision for an advanced compensation in favour of the victim or, "
"in the event of death, of the beneficiaries who, as a consequence of the offences of "
"homicide, sexual assault or grievous bodily harm, and deformation of appearance by means "
"of permanent facial injuries, committed by a spouse, including a separated or divorced "
150 
" spouse, or by a person who is or has been bound by a relationship of  affection to the "
"offended person, find themselves in a state of need;  "
"- establishes that, for offences of attempted murder or, in the forms committed or "
"attempted, ill -treatment against family members and cohabitees, sexual violence, sexual "
"acts with a mino r, corruption of a minor, group sexual violence, persecutory acts, as well as "
certain aggravated cases of personal injury and deformation of the appearance of the 
person by means of permanent facial injuries committed in the context of domestic 
"violence, t he police body prosecuting the complaint or lawsuit - if the initial investigations "
reveal concrete and relevant elements of danger of a repetition of the conduct - notifies the 
Prefect who may adopt dynamic surveillance measures to protect the offended pe rson;  
"- provides for the possibility of arrest, even outside cases of flagrante delicto  (in which arrest "
"is mandatory), no later than forty -eight hours after the offence has been committed, and "
"serves to allow arrest even if the person, at the time of arriva l of the police, has moved "
away.  
 
2.2 Policy changes  
Following the issuance in 2015 of the first Extraordinary Action Plan against Sexual and Gender -
"based Violence and the National Strategic Plan on Male Violence against Women 2017 -2020, the "
third National Strategic Plan on Male Violence against Women for the two -year period 2021 -2023 
was recently adopted.  
 
The Plan has provided a set of measures to create a society free from violence. The focus is on 
"strengthening the enjoyment of fundamental right s, preventing, and contrasting this phenomenon "
and addressing those conditions that cause social and economic exclusion of women and girls 
putting them at highest risk to be victims of violence.  
 
"In continuity with the previous Strategic Plan 2017 -2020, t he Plan is articulated along key Axes in "
"accordance with core -lines of action of the Istanbul Convention: Prevention, Protection, and "
"Support, Prosecution and Punishment, Assistance and Promotion. In addition, each Axis is associated "
"with specific Prioriti es, which address the most significant dimensions of male violence against "
women.  
 
"With regard to prevention, the priorities are: increase of awareness in public opinion and in the "
educational and training system on causes and consequences of male violence  against women; the 
"involvement of the private sector (social, platforms, mass media) on stereotypes and sexism, also in "
relation to cyber -violence and illegal dissemination of sexually explicit images or videos; the 
promotion of female empowerment through  actions to emerge and combat violence against women 
victims of multiple discrimination; reinforced prevention of recidivism for men perpetrators of 
"violence; the training of professional figures who, in various capacities, interact with women victims "
"and minors in the path of prevention, support and reintegration; regulatory measures also to "
prevent secondary victimisation.  
 
"On victims’ protection and support, the priorities are: taking in charge women victims of violence "
"and minors who witness violence; t he activation of paths of economic -financial empowerment, "
employment and housing autonomy; the monitoring and improvement of the effectiveness of the 
‘Pathways for women who suffer violence’ provided by health authorities and hospitals; the 
strengthening o f the national free anti -violence hotline 1522; the protection and psycho -social 
support of minors who witness violence; the implementation of operational solutions to guarantee 
"access to prevention, support and reintegration services, in particular for wo men victims of multiple "
"discrimination (migrants, asylum seekers and refugees).  "
 
"With regard to the axis of prosecute and punish, the priorities are: guarantee procedures and tools "
for the protection of women victims of violence that allow an effective and  rapid assessment and 
"management of the risk of lethality, reiteration and recidivism; to define a shared model of "
151 
" approach, management and risk assessment; to improve the effectiveness of judicial proceedings "
when applying precautionary measures and sente nces; to define guidelines for the analysis and 
qualitative and quantitative monitoring of interventions carried out within the programmes for 
abused men.  
 
"Finally, in the field of assistance and promotion, the priorities are: the implementation of an "
integrated information system for data collection and analysis; the implementation of a national 
"monitoring and evaluation system of interventions, policies, activities and resources; the "
"preparation of guidelines, in agreement with Regions, to harmonise q ualitative and quantitative "
"standards of services provided by the anti -violence centres, territorial networks and the socio -health "
system on a national level; information and awareness about regulatory tools and operational 
interventions in support of wome n victims of male violence.  
 
"With regard to available financial resources to support the actions envisaged by the Plan, reference "
should be made to the Fund for Equal Opportunities whose allocation is established by Ministry of 
the Economy and Finance and then managed within the budget of the Presidency of the Council: for 
2022 it amounts to EUR 39.1 million.  
 
2.3 Institutional changes  
"On 13 May 2022, the Decrees of 29 March and 12 April 2022, signed by Minister for Equal "
"Opportunities and the Family, were published in the Official Bulletin, establishing the inter -"
institutional Steering Committee and the Observatory on the phenomenon of violence against 
women and domestic violence.  
 
2.4 Research and awareness raising  
The lack of data on the incidence of crimes involving women as victims has been tackled by the 
National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) and the Department for Equal Opportunities through the 
"creation of a dedicated webpage on the ISTAT website, providing an integrated information "
framework  on violence against women in Italy.  
 
An accurate analysis of crimes concerning the phenomenon of male violence against women is 
"carried out periodically by the Department of Public Security of the Ministry of the Interior, which "
publishes on its website weekly and half -yearly monitoring reports on the most widespread crimes 
against women.  
 
3. Strategic objective: Ensure the equal access of women to justice  
 
3.1 Legislative changes  
"- the accessibility, responsiveness, competence and gender -sensitivity of legal aid and public "
defence to the needs of women . 
 
"In case of destitute subjects , irrespective of their gender, the State shall provide for the so -called "
legal aid  in both civil and criminal cases. It can be granted upon request of a party by the Bar 
Association (COA) of the forum of the litigation based on objective criteria such as lack of income 
"and no manifestly ill -founded claim. According to recent case -law, i n the matter of legal aid, lawyers "
"of the party qualified for legal aid cannot claim their fees from their clients, in the absence of an "
"order revoking the benefit issued by the judge of the main proceeding. Therefore, only after the "
"issuance of the revoca tion order can lawyers claim their fees, in full or, in case of changes in the "
"financial conditions of their client, at the time the said change occurs (see Cass. 10669/ 2020). Under "
"Articles 112 and 136, second paragraph, of Presidential Decree No. 115/20 02 “the judge, by means "
"of decree revokes the qualification for legal aid provisionally ordered by the Bar Association, where "
the relevant requirements are not satisfied...”. Revocation shall be ordered only in the interest of 
152 
" the State and not of the lawy er, and it is not admissible after the case is settled, on grounds that the "
party acted or resisted in court in bad faith or gross negligence  (see Cass viv. N. 10669/2020).  
 
"Under Article 76 (4) of Presidential Decree No. 115/2002, as reformulated in 2009,  victims of "
"offences covered by Articles 572, 583 -bis, 609 -bis, 609 -quater, 609 -octies and 612 -bis, as well as, "
"underage victims of offences covered by Articles 600, 600 -bis, 600 -ter, 600 -quinquies, 601, 602, 609 -"
"quinquies and 609 -undecies of the criminal Code, may also be admitted to legal aid in derogation of "
the income limits laid down in the law provisions on legal aid.  
 
"Therefore, in principle, the procedural rules on legal aid do not differ from those laid down in respect "
"of every destitute person. By  contrast, technical trial defence is supported by the State for certain "
"types of offences exempted from income limits, as is the case for family abuse, female genital "
"mutilation acts and sexual abuse, mostly affecting the female gender.  "
 
- the rules on th e burden of proof in order to ensure a fair treatment of women’s cases ; 
 
"It is worth noting that the Italian legal system, both from the criminal and civil viewpoint, does not "
allow for a particular regime of the burden of proof and relevant gender related  evaluation. 
"Nonetheless, selected categories of subjects are entitled to some evidentiary facilities, irrespective "
of gender.  
 
Evidence of workplace bullying  and the court's unofficial powers were the focus of many lower court 
"judgments in the framework of labour litigation. Under the Italian legal system, when the civil "
"dispute affects workers, female or male, the labour procedural rules laid down in Title IV  of the Code "
of Civil procedure shall apply which are special in nature and afford sufficient safeguards in favour 
"of workers, regardless of their gender. The balance between the principle of the adversarial system "
"and the requirement of the search for mat erial truth  is at the heart of labour litigation . Therefore, "
"whenever the findings of a case yield substantial evidentiary data, the judge who deems the "
"evidence already acquired insufficient, should not merely apply the conventional trial rule based on "
"the burden of proof, but is compelled and empowered to trigger ex officio the investigative acts "
urged by such evidence and suitable for overcoming the uncertainty of the facts underlying the 
"disputed rights, regardless of any bar or limitation to the detrim ent of the parties. What’s more, "
while the use of ex officio powers under Article 421 of the Code of Civil Procedure shall always be 
"justified, failure to exercise them, should only be substantiated in connection with specific "
"circumstances requiring furth er evidence. (Cass. 24 October 2007 No. 22305; Cass. Sez. L - , Order "
No. 24024 of 6 September 2021 on the unofficial authority to order an expert opinion).  
 
"As to the relaxation of the burden of proof in favour of persons complaining of discrimination , it "
"was highlighted (see Cass. 27 September 2018 No. 23338, Cass. 12 October 2018 No. 25543) under "
"the directives on the matter at issue, No. 2000/78, as well as No. 2006/54 and 2000/43, as "
"interpreted by the Court of Justice, and transposing legislative decr ees which require the "
introduction of a mechanism of evidentiary facilitation or the mitigation of the burden of proof on 
"the claimant, that claimants are required to submit allegations and prove factual circumstances from "
"which it can be inferred that dis crimination has indeed taken place, whereas it on the employer to "
"prove the absence of discrimination. (see. Cass. No. 14206 of 2013, on gender discrimination). The "
"mere application of the burden of proof in terms of Article 2729 of the Civil Code, whereby  each "
"party is required to comply with the burden of proof principle, is not in line with the European law "
and the reading of the provision in Article 4 of Legislative Decree 216/2003 (which was followed by 
"the introduction of Article 28 of Legislative Dec ree No. 150/2011, preceded by the opening of an "
infringement procedure against Italy for failing to comply with the criteria set out by the directive at 
"issue), is now interpreted not as a real and actual reversal of the burden of proof, but rather a "
facil itation in favour of persons complaining of discrimination  and may find it difficult to 
"demonstrate discriminatory acts against them, notably in cases involving a plurality of workers (Cass. "
civ. n.1/2020).  
153 
  
"It follows that it is on persons claiming discri mination to demonstrate the risk factor, the treatment "
they assume as less favourable than that provided to persons in similar conditions and not carrying 
"the risk factor, deriving a significant correlation between these elements which make discrimination "
"plausible. By contrast, the person held accountable shall infer and demonstrate unmistakeable "
"circumstances, apt to exclude, by accuracy, seriousness and consistency of interpretation, the "
"discriminatory nature of the act (i.e., termination), insofar as it  demonstrates a choice that would "
"have been made with the same parameters with respect to any worker lacking the risk factor, placed "
in the same position (see Cass. No. 14206/13 in line with the indications by the Court of Justice 
"17 July 2008, C -303/06 Co lemann, ; C -54/07 Feryn, 16.7.15 ; C - 83/14 Chez).  "
 
"Wide criminal protection  is embedded in the Italian legal system depending on the background, "
"frequency and intensity of the discriminatory activity, as this conduct may amount to different "
indictable off ences. Prosecution shall establish the type of alleged offence which may be otherwise 
"typified by the court within a different legal framework, without prejudice to the offended party or "
the defence rights (see point 3.4 which follows).  
 
"When the discriminatory conduct is liable to prosecution, proof of the relevant liability is subject to "
a stringent burden of proof (beyond any reasonable doubt) on behalf of the prosecutor in charge of 
"the case, arising from the statute of guarantees affo rded to the defendant under Article 27 of the "
"Constitution , in that “ it must be ascertained, evaluating the events brought before the court and "
claimed as damaging ... which may be demonstrated because of their continuation and duration over 
"time, by the o bjective persecution and discriminatory nature, arising from emulative and prejudicial "
"features ” ( Cass. Crim. div. 5, judgment No. 33624 of 9 July 2007)  "
 
- rules to allow groups and civil society organisations with an interest in a given case to lodge 
petitions and participate in the proceedings ; 
 
The Italian legal system envisages several forms of protection of collective interests.  
 
"In the first place, the Statute of Labourers, a law dating back to the seventies and still in force, "
"stipulates that the pr oceeding under Article 28  aimed at suppressing anti -union conducts, is "
restricted to cases in which the protection of the union’s collective interest  in the free exercise of 
"its prerogatives is at stake, an interest that is distinct and autonomous vis -à-vis that of individual "
"worker s. For example, in terms of redundancy funds, the assistance of the union or union "
"representatives in the factory, or in case of absence of the leading representative confederation is "
"laid down in Article 5 of Law 20 May 1975, No . 164 (on “Measures to secure wages”) for the purposes "
"of examining the overall business situation, reviewing the crisis, if any, as well as assessing the "
"interests of workers in a global dimension, so as to protect the collective interests of workers and "
"safeguarding employment levels. There is no question that, in respect of the specific positions of "
"individual workers, such a measure is in itself suitable for guaranteeing that the choice of employees "
"to be placed on lay -off, including when timing and sta ges have been agreed upon in the union, is not "
"the result of discrimination to the detriment of some and in favour of other employees (Cass. Sez. L, "
judgment No. 6338 of 6 June 1995).  
 
"Article 5, paragraph 2, of Legislative Decree No. 216/2003  stipulates t hat action be undertaken by "
"trade unions, associations and organisations representing the right or the interest affected where "
"collective discrimination is claimed against a group of workers identifiable by union membership , "
and hence not directly or immed iately identified as persons harmed by discrimination (see Cass. 
"20 July 2018 -19443). Despite the points of contact, the two procedural actions reserved for the "
union are different and the choice to make the union membership part of the personal conviction  
grounds may result in making the two actions partly fungible (Cass. Sez.l. n. 1/2020).  
 
154 
" In criminal cases, trade unions are entitled to join as civil parties in the criminal proceeding to protect "
"the same collective interests, even if the offence involves  an individual worker, when a "
discrimination issue arises. According to case -law the type of offence encompassing the elements 
typical of the so -called bullying  is the one described in Article 572 of the Criminal Code (abuse) 
"committed by a person vested w ith authority to practice a profession. In this respect, a case (which "
"has turned out to be notorious) involving a mass bullying of the LAF building in Taranto, Italy, was "
"ruled by the Court of Cassation, VI criminal division, 21 September 2006, No. 31413 that established "
that the offences of attempted private violence and fraud in obtaining a judgment had been 
"committed. In these circumstances, employers who forced or tried to force some employees into "
accepting a renegotiation of the employment relationsh ip involving their “demotion” (in the case at 
issue being a downgrading from the position of clerk to that of worker) by threatening to otherwise 
assign them to forced and humiliating inertia in a crumbling environment marginalised from the rest 
"of the cor porate context, with a view to their future dismissal, were liable of private violence, "
"attempted or committed. Cassazione, VI sez. pen, 11 June 2007, No. 22702 and Cassazione, VI sez. "
"pen., 7 November 2007, No. 40891 have applied, for other types of offen ces, the provision on abuses "
in official acts: the first judgment in a case of demotion and defamation committed by a person in a 
"higher position (who had failed to formally complain to their subordinates about their shortcomings, "
"but had instead written t hem down in letters addressed to superiors), whereas in the second "
judgment the provision was applied affirming that the change of duties of a municipal employee 
from performing the role of bursar co -ordinator to preventing and detecting parking infringeme nts 
"amounts to an offence. In its reasoning, the Court highlighted that said provisions, though allowing "
"the assignment of an employee to lower -level duties, nevertheless require the occasional nature of "
the assignment and the possibility that this takes p lace on a rotational basis.  
 
"Likewise, women’s rights associations enjoy, by well -established principle, active and passive "
"legitimacy, to assert the collective interest in protecting women’s rights. For instance, in the matter "
"of sexual offences , the muni cipality where the offence was committed is entitled to intervene as a "
civil party in order to obtain compensation for moral and material damages deriving from the direct 
"and immediate violation of the statutory purpose. In this respect, see Cass. Criminal  division 3, "
judgment no. 45963 of 27 June 2017: the municipality of Turin was indeed entitled to intervene as a 
"civil party in the proceeding, being the funder and direct provider of services specifically aimed at "
"victims of sexual violence, and by statut e and in a tangible way committed to combating violence "
"against women. Also, Cass. Criminal Division VI, 16 April 2009, No. 16031 held that was admissible "
"for the regional councilwomen of equality to join the civil action, jure proprio , as party harmed by "
"the crime, in relation to a case of abuse to the detriment of a group of female workers committed "
"by a supervisor of the employer (see comment in Notiz. Giurisprud. Lav., 2009, 305).  "
 
"However, where no union right is involved, judicial protection aimed at eradicating discriminatory "
"conducts, in terms of Articles 4 of Legislative Decree No. 215 of 2003 and 28 of Legislative Decree "
No. 150 of 2011 falls within the general rule of Article 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Interest in 
"action) Hence, in the ev ent of early settlement of the case, the persistence of the need for the entity "
"bearer of the collective interest to take action should be excluded, as the link with the factual matter "
"in relation to which the need for protection had arisen has ceased. Div ision L - , judgment No. 32388 "
"of 8 November 2021; Cass. Division 2 -, judgment No. 2057 of 24 January 2019; Cass. Division L - , "
judgment no. 11165 of 8 May 2017).  
 
The assessment of the damage suffered by the victim of the discriminatory act and by bodie s tasked 
with the protection of collective interests can only be fair and both academia and case -law hold that 
"account should be taken not only of the consequences produced in the legal sphere of the victim, "
"but also aspects pertaining to the agent, such a s the criminal relevance, if any, the degree of "
"unlawfulness, as well as the possible enrichment in terms of costs restrictions.  "
 
"- the removal from existing laws, procedures, regulations, jurisprudence, customs, of direct or "
indirect discrimination against women . 
155 
  
As highlighted by the European Commission in its Communications on the Strategy for Gender 
"Equality 2020 -2025, no member State has achieved gender equality so far: progress is slow and "
"gender gaps persist in the labour market at the level o f wages, welfare and pensions, in leadership "
"positions, and in participation in political and institutional life. In view of the new Horizon Europe "
"funding programme for research and innovation (2021 -2027), by the end of February 2021, the "
"European Union p ublished (ECR) European Research Council Work Programme, covering technical "
information for prospective applicants and funding requests. An important new innovation stands 
out in the new Horizon Europe calls for proposals: the entity that would host the re search in case of 
"successful application, is required to declare that a Plan for Gender Equality is in place, better known "
as Gender Equality Plan (GEP).  
 
In the 2020 Gender Equality Index published by the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) 
"Italy scored 63.50 out of 100. However, this score is lower in the areas of power, leisure and "
knowledge.  
 
"The gender equality issue has become even more pressing during pandemic emergency, whose "
"impact affected the female gender both in the labour field (out of the 444,000 fewer people "
"employed in Italy in all 2020, 70% are women) and in the social sphere, with an increase in domestic "
violence. This is why emergency laws passed in the age of pandemic prioritised all issues related to 
"women’s protection, vulner able people and minors which were in fact not subject to suspensions or "
deferral in courts.  
 
Overcoming gender disparities is the focus of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) to 
kick-start the national development in the aftermath of the pande mic. Gender equality is one of the 
"three cross -cutting priorities pursued in all its six missions. Basically, the measures envisaged by the "
NRRP in favour of gender equality are mainly addressed to promoting greater female participation 
"rate in the labour market, by means of: Direct initiatives to support women’s employment and "
"entrepreneurship, indirect or enabling initiatives targeted at boosting educational services for "
children and given social services  listed in the NRRP that are likely to encourage in creased female 
employment.  
 
It is worth highlighting that both direct and indirect discrimination are typified in Article 2 of 
"Legislative Decree 216/2003 , whereby direct discrimination refers to cases where “ because of "
"religion, personal beliefs, handicap , age or sexual orientation persons are treated less favourably if "
they were in a similar situation ” whereas indirect discrimination refers to cases where “ an ostensibly 
"impartial provision, standard, practice, act, covenant or conduct may place persons pr actising a "
"religion or ideology of another nature, persons with disabilities, persons of a particular age or sexual "
orientation at a particular disadvantage compared to other persons ”. 
 
"What’s more, Italy is actively involved in the European Union negotiat ion on the proposal for "
"directive on equal pay  through wage transparency, where the key points are to recognise the "
"effectiveness of workers’ rights, even if not formally on employment contract, by setting reduced "
"litigation costs and limitation periods , starting from when the claimant is aware of or should "
reasonably be aware of the violation.  
 
"These principles are embedded in the Italian legal system, which can be retrieved in Article 92 (2) of "
the code of civil procedure stipulating a mitigation of the p rinciple of the acquiescence in lawsuit 
"with respect to litigation costs in the event of novelties arising, changes in case -law or “serious or "
"exceptional reasons” (see Constitutional court, judgment 19 April 2018 No. 77). The last passage "
"covers a general  clause suitable for a given socio -historical context or special situations, not exactly "
"and effectively definable in advance, but to be clarified in the interpretation by the judge on the "
"merits of the case (see Cass. Division 6 - 2, Order No. 7992 of 11 March 2022). In addition, Article "
2935 of the Civil Code stipulates that the limitation period shall start running from the day on which 
156 
" the right can be claimed. In the legislation on labour relations or in cases of alleged discrimination, "
the said princi ples have always been highly valued in court proceedings.  
 
"In this respect, it is worth recalling, as a cornerstone, the European Court of Justice judgment handed "
"down on 3 June 2021 in the matter of K and others vs Tesco Stores Ldt, C -624/19, establishing the "
"principle of equal pay for “work of equal value”  for m en and women alike, no longer related to the "
"notion of “same work” or “equal work”, which has shown all its limitations, but instead work "
"originating from a single source: the same employer. It was through this principle, enshrined in "
"Article 157 TFEU and always regarded as having direct effect on ordinary courts, that wage "
transparency was established at European level to counter to discriminatory gender difference 
(gender pay gap).  
 
"However, the said principle can only be applied in respect of subordinate  work.  "
 
There is a consensus among scholars that the pay gap between the two distinct genders (male and 
"female) holds today a notoriously greater weight in self -employment, where the female sex suffers "
"from a certain type of customers, sectors of operation  and the inability to achieve a total number of "
"hours worked at the same level as that offered by the male sex, receiving 60% of the pay of a man "
of the same level  
 
"(see. Anna Zilli, nota a Corte di giustizia UE, 3 giugno 2021, C - 624/19 , in law on industr ial relations, "
"fasc. 3 , 2021 , 956).  "
 
"In addition, it should be highlighted that at domestic level, currently no provisions covering "
workplace bullying  are in place. It is likewise significant that the majority of cases on record in case -
"law, where this f orm of discrimination, both vertical and horizontal, has been transposed and "
"examined, involve women workers. It worth noting that workplace bullying  is covered in the anti-"
discriminatory  sets of law passed by the parliament or transposing EU regulations.  
 
"The EU notion of discrimination, transposed in domestic law by Legislative Decrees No. 215 and 216 "
"of 2003, includes harassment and order of discrimination (regardless of its execution) on account of "
typified grounds: “ Harassment is to be considered a for m of discrimination in case of any unwanted 
conduct adopted with the aim or effect of violating the dignity of a person and creating an 
"intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating and abusive environment ”. From a practical viewpoint, "
equating harassment with discrimination makes it possible to apply the facilitating evidentiary 
regime  and the highly stringent sanction regime laid down in the anti -discriminatory regulations.  
 
"What is more, it should be recalled that sources of law include “relevant grounds” for a conduct to "
"amount to discrimination. In EU regulations, and hence in transposing decrees, reference is made to "
"race, ethnic origin, religion, beliefs, disabilities, ag e, sex, sexual orientation , whereas in domestic "
"regulations in addition to the referred grounds also language, political belief, religious belief, trade "
"union membership, participation in trade union activities and HIV status  are taken into account. "
"These are the typical grounds for discrimination, that is the grounds underlying acts or conducts that "
the legal system qualifies as discriminatory from a technical viewpoint and accordingly provides for 
"a specific protection. In this respect, the Supreme Court,  by ruling No. 10037/2015 dealing with a "
"case of a city employee found to have been “ deprived of her duties and consequently marginalised, "
"being moved with no valid reasons from one office to another, humiliated for being placed under the "
"direction of her former subordinate, being assigned to an office open to the public without having "
the possibility of being able to work which made her humiliation even more bitter ” indicated the 
specific criteria (7) for holding this conduct as discrimination typifying th e relevant features in the 
"case -law. Hence, the referred conduct is typified by: (1) conflicts, mortifications or whatever must "
"last for a reasonable period of time (2) be not episodic, but reiterated and multiple. (3) multiple "
"hostile actions must occur, including at least: (4) attacks on the ability to communicate, "
"marginalisation on a regular basis, changes in work duties, attacks on reputation, violence or threats, "
157 
" a disparity between the opposing parties, with the claimant self -evident inferiority. (5)  The case shall "
"unfold according to the subsequent steps: targeted conflict, initiation of bullying , psychosomatic "
"symptoms, mistakes and abuse, aggravation of health conditions, exclusion from work. (6) In "
"addition to all listed above, there must be perse cutory intent, (7) that is, a premeditated intent to "
"harass the employee (criteria also confirmed in Cass. Division L - , judgment No. 7097 of 22 March "
2018).  
 
Another aspect regulated by our national law makers that may indirectly affect every kind of 
"discrimination is legislation on safety in the workplace , more recently set out by Legislative Decree  "
"No. 81 of 9 April 2008. The above legislation does not addres s bullying directly, but sets forth "
different useful rules: for instance the definition of workers’ health  itself (as a state of complete 
"physical, mental and social wellbeing, and not only the absence of disease or infirmity) or a wide -"
ranging and general  rule on “ risk assessment” falling under the obligatory and non -delegable 
responsibility (Article 16) of employers (called on to make a global and informed assessment of all 
"the risks for the health and safety of workers employed in their organisation, to identify adequate "
prevention and protection measures  and put in place a programme of measures capable of 
"ensuring the improvement over time of the levels of security and health) , or lastly  the scope of the "
"rules on safety (which concern all types of risks , in every activity).  "
 
"Apart from the above rules, we have the general principle provided for in Article  2087 of the civil "
"code  entitled “ protection of working conditions ”, which provides for - as legal effect of the contract, "
"and not as a natural conseque nce thereof, since it is not an obligation that may be departed from - "
the obligation on employers to protect the physical integrity and moral personality  of workers. 
"The said obligation goes in conjunction with Articles 2049 and 2059 of the civil code, an d the regime "
of co -responsibility of employers for acts put in place by their employees that cause non -pecuniary 
"damages to other employees. The said discipline, in its capacity as “ gap -filling rule” of “the system, "
puts on employers a special and autonom ous obligation to protect workers in as much as persons 
"and sets forth a particularly wide -ranging and flexible rule, comprehensive not only of the obligation "
to comply with the conditions and restraints set forth by the laws and regulations on accident 
"prevention in the workplace and occupational hygiene, but also to introduce and maintain measures "
"capable of concretely preventing accidents and any harm to workers, as a result of natural or artificial "
hazardous factors in the work environment that may affe ct not only the psycho -physical integrity of 
"workers but also their moral personality . Under  Article  2087 of the Civil Code , employers are also "
obliged to refrain from introducing “ straining ” working conditions that may harm the fundamental 
"rights of emplo yees. In fact, on this point, trial judges, even when they find that there is no "
"persecutory intent capable of unifying the incidents in such a way as to amount to “bullying”, are "
"under the obligation to assess whether pursuant to the elements of the case - its characteristics, "
"seriousness, personal or professional frustration or other circumstances - it is possible to assume the "
"existence of this less severe damage (Cass. Division L, Judgment n. 3291 of 19 February 2016 Cc. "
"Division L -, ORDER n. 2676 of 4 F ebruary 2021 Cc.  "
 
Our national law maker has been showing interest in bullying for some time and in the course of 
recent legislatures different bills have been submitted.  
 
The above unlawful acts may amount to different forms of disciplinary wrongdoings a lso for the 
"people assigned to a specific unit, and not only for employers.  "
 
Acts of bullying may amount to criminal offences (leading to compensation for the so -called moral 
"or immaterial damage caused to a person), when they amounts to: violence against  a person (Article "
"610 of the Criminal Code), bodily injuries (Article 582 of the Criminal Code), death or bodily injuries "
"as a consequence of another offence (Article 586 of the Criminal Code), incitement to commit suicide "
"(Article 580 of the Criminal Cod e), harassment (Article 660 of the Criminal Code), sexual harassment "
or sexual violence (Article 609 bis of the Criminal Code) abuses (Article 572 of the Criminal Code) 
"slander or libel (Articles 594 and 595 of the Criminal Code), abuse of Office (Article 323 of the "
158 
" Criminal Code), discriminatory conduct (Articles 15 and 38 st.lab, and 4 of Legislative Decree 216 of "
2003). It is possible to apply the aggravating circumstances as per Articles 61 n. 11 of the Criminal 
"Code (when the act is committed by abuse of authority or abuse of family relations, or by abuse of "
"office relations, abuse of performance of service or of hospitality).  "
 
In terms of compensation due for harassment or abuses suffered in the workplace by a public 
"servant, the Civil Joint Divisions of the Supreme Court of cassation, by judgment No. 13246 of 16 "
"May 2019, Rv. 654026 -01, rendered at the hearing of 09 April 2019,  enunciated that: “The State or "
public entity  shall answer in a civil lawsuit for the damage caused to third parties by the criminal 
wrongdoing put in place by an employee even when the latter has taken advantage of his office and 
"acted for exclusively per sonal and selfish ends that are estranged from those of his administration, "
as long as his conduct is linked to his functions and would not have otherwise been put in place if he 
had not covered such functions or had had such powers . (“nesso di occasionali tà necessaria ”). An 
unlawful conduct that is a source of a claimable damage - resulting from an unlawful damage to third 
"parties - consequently has to be connected to the exercise of the function or powers in question, "
"which although deviated or abusive or  unlawful, do not amount to an objectively anomalous "
behaviour.  
 
"In terms of  an employer’s criminal liability for acts that amount to bullying,  the Supreme Court of "
"cassation has ruled on the matter on different occasions, setting forth the elements of the  relevant "
"criminal offences. By judgment cass, VI criminal division, 22 January 2001, No. 10090, the Supreme "
Court handed down some elements that abstractly constitute the offence of abuses against 
"subordinates in workplace relations, pointing out that “th ese acts constitute the offence of abuses "
"envisaged by Article  572 of the Criminal code, and not the offence of “abuse of means of correction "
"or discipline” (Article 571 of the Criminal code). In another case, the Supreme Court (Cass. 29 August "
"2007, n. 33 624, (att.17) cleared that a court has to exclude the offence of voluntary aggravated "
bodily harm caused by an alteration of the tone and mood of a teacher when the individual harmful 
"acts allegedly causing the said harm are not specified, considering that  the claimed phenomenon "
requires a targeted reiteration of multiple converging attitudes expressing hostility against the victim 
and preordained at humiliating and isolating an employee in the work environment. On the other 
"hand, the said phenomenon, as it  is described, appears to be closer to the offence as per Article  572 "
"of the Criminal Code (abuses committed by an individual invested with authority),  which applies "
when the hostile actions in any case meet the parameters of frequency and duration in time  with a 
view to assessing their overall persecutory and discriminatory character (in the case at issue not fully 
"charged )>>. The judgment, although excluding the appropriateness of the indictment in relation to "
"the charged offence, explains that “ bullying presumes not so much an individual harmful act but a "
"targeted reiteration of a multitude of attitudes, even if not individually constituting a criminal "
"offence, convergent both in expressing the hostility of the perpetrator against the victim and in "
having  an effective capacity of humiliating and isolating the employee in the work environment”.   
 
"Lastly, in terms of the criminal case law, the Court of Turin of First Instance on 3 May 2005 handed "
"down the first court ruling on the merit to consider the issue  of the importance, or not, in an "
"indictment for abuses, of an employer’s  jus corrigendi in relation to the unlawful conduct of a "
"worker, excluding its justification also in view of the specificity of the disciplinary sanctions an "
employer may resort to wh en his employees violate the rules on the proper performance of their 
work.  
 
We need to stress that in criminal proceedings instituted to ascertain the commission of offences 
"against women, the decision of the Strasbourg Court, in judgment M.C. vs Italy of  7 July 2022 (No. "
"32715/19), and again in judgment De Gregori vs Italy of 16 June 2022 (n. 23735/19), covers the "
question of  domestic violence . 
 
"Italy has been convicted, in the case at issue, in relation to a part of the time taken into consideration, "
for a “substantive law” violation of Article 3 of the Convention on Human Right and Fundamental 
159 
 Freedoms (in respect of a given period considered by the application) and “procedural law” violation 
"(always in relation to the failed promptness and diligence to respond of the judicial authorities, "
aggravated by the running out of the time limitation). Nearly all the criminal proceedings instituted 
against the husband ended with the acquittal of the defendant because the time limitation of the 
"offences charged had  run out. Only in 2020, thus sixteen years after the applicant first reported the "
"wrongdoings, did the Court of First Instance hold her husband guilty, sentencing him to three years "
in prison for harassments. The above ruling can only be construed in conju nction with the decision 
of the CEDAW Committee (UN Committee monitoring the implementation of the Convention on the 
"Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women) of 18 July 2022, where in a case of "
domestic violence and rape (perpetrated by th e agent tasked to conduct investigations on the 
"domestic violence), it condemned Italy for having violated Articles 2 (b) -(d) and (f), 3, 5 and 15 of the "
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.  
 
"In any case, Italy is ful ly aware of the need to closely monitor domestic and gender violence (the "
"judgment keeps account of the progress in our legislation). On this point, the report passed by the "
"Parliamentary Committee investigating femicide at the hearing of 20 April 2022, as  well as any form "
"of gender violence, Doc. XXII -bis n.10, of the senate of the Republic, precisely indicated that “ the "
need to ascertain the size and scope of the phenomenon of secondary victimisation furthermore 
arises from the awareness that only a coher ent answer of all the institutions may hinder the 
spreading of the endemic phenomenon of domestic and gender violence. Domestic violence cannot 
be curbed by the relevant criminal legislation and criminal proceedings and its effects ignored in the 
proceedin gs on the custody of children or parental responsibility” .  
 
"The recent reforms of the criminal code and the code of criminal procedure (red Code), as well as "
"the civil trial system (Cartabia reform), intend remedying the aforementioned criticalities (see point "
3.4).  
 
"The Italian legal system also fights against gender violence, which takes shape in the unlawful "
activities committed on the internet.  
 
"In terms of prevention, precautionary measures may be taken by specialised judicial police units, "
"(the Postal Police Serv ice) under the instructions of the judicial authorities, in an effort to stop users "
of the web having access to sites that have unlawful contents. Access to an internet domain is 
prevented by requiring the internet service provider to take the site offline . The injured party may 
ask for the unlawful content to be rectified or removed by the site’s data processor or by the National 
"Data Protection Authority, as well as seek redress in the competent civil courts (v. infra).  "
 
"In terms of evidence collection, our national law maker (Article 347, paragraph 3, of the Code of "
Criminal Procedure) has envisaged a particularly short time to collect evidence in respect of offences 
"of gender violence, including offences committed on the web (for example hearing the vic tim within "
"three days from the entry of the offence in the Register of Offences, to ensure a timely investigation "
on the dynamics of the events; the obligation on the Judicial Police to immediately refer to the Public 
Prosecutor also orally on the circumst ances of the case). These measures show the special attention 
placed on the victim of the offence and the need for a timely and essentially comprehensive 
collection of the evidence.  
 
With reference to investigations on the unlawful conducts put in place t hrough the use of internet 
"services, by decree handed down by the Judicial Authority it is possible to get from the providers of "
"the platforms used by the victim or author of the crime, the log files of accesses to the computer "
systems used to put in place  intimidating conducts or by using the holder’s credentials to otherwise 
"unlawfully access, as is often the case, the computer systems in the victim’s place.  "
 
In terms of what a victim can do against the holder of the information who has unlawfully process ed 
"and published the information or images, and apart from the criminal protection generally afforded "
160 
" by the national systems in respect of wrongdoings committed by internet providers or by their users, "
in terms of private enforcement a person may protect his/her personal data on the internet by 
exercising the rights envisaged by Articles 15 and 22 of Regulation (EU 2016/679 on data protection 
"- GDPR). The data subject may file a request with the data controller, without following any specific "
"formalities ( e.g., by certified mail, telefax, e -mail, etc.). On the site of the National Data Protection "
Authority a form is available that may be used to exercise the above -mentioned rights. The request 
"may refer, depending on the needs of the data subject, to specif ic personal data, data categories or "
"a specific processing, or to all the personal data concerning him/her, no matter how it was "
processed. The data processing controller shall respond appropriately to the request: - without 
"undue delay, at the latest with in 1 month of its receipt - the said deadline may be extended to 2 "
"months, as the need may be depending on the complexity and number of complaints. In such case, "
the data controller shall in any case inform the data subject within 1 month of receipt of his /her 
request. Should the data subject find that the processing of his/her data breaches existing provisions 
or that an answer to his/her request where the data subject is exercising one or more of the rights 
"envisaged by Articles 15 -22 of Regulation (EU) 2 016/679, does not come within the prescribed time "
"or is not satisfactory, then the data subject may seize the competent judicial authority or the "
National Data Protection Authority. In this latter case the data subject shall lodge a complaint under 
Article  77 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.  
 
"In this respect, the Protocols put in place by the Prosecuting Offices in the matter of domestic and "
"gender violence, whether committed through the internet or not, are both of use and effective.  "
 
It is also important to highlight the continuous interpretation work of both the Supreme and lower 
Courts in their case law. All the while compliant with the criminal law principles of the strict and 
"detailed description of offences by law and the prohibition to apply the princip le of analogy, these "
courts - in the perspective of a growing use of technological media - have pursued the protection of 
"the fundamental rights which can be breached also by acts of cyber violence , by referring explicitly "
to the principles of the Istanbul  Convention.  
 
" - the accessibility, responsiveness, competence and gender -sensitivity of legal aid and public "
defence to the needs of women .  
 
We refer to our answers above or below.  
 
3.2 Policy changes  
There is a growing awareness that the Italian legal system has to make a formative effort both in 
terms of national and supranational (also of soft law) rules and the case law of the Court of cassation 
"and the Strasbourg Court, but also change the cultural  structure of gender violence and the ancient "
"and unaware mechanisms that tend to minimise it or blame the victims. In fact, the Istanbul "
"Convention, in terms of offences perpetrated by men against women, requires institutions to first "
"ascertain the relati onships of power from which these acts develop and are committed. Otherwise, "
"the risk is not to interpret them correctly, to mitigate them to the point of creating an effect of "
impunity and tolerance vis a vis their authors.  
 
An investigative Committee ha s been set up within Parliament on the secondary victimisation of 
women suffering violence and their children in proceedings settling custody and parental 
"responsibility matters (Doc. XXII -bis No.10 of the Senate of the Republic, XXII Legislature). It has  "
"carried out a thorough and documented investigation on the causes of femicide, as well as on every "
form of gender violence. The Committee underscored that in the same legal system it is not possible 
"to tolerate that, on the one hand, the author of violent  acts is investigated and convicted for them "
"and, on the other, is considered a suitable parent at par with the parent that suffered the violence "
before a civil and juvenile court where the said acts are not ascertained and do not have direct 
"consequences on the matter of parental authority. Consequently, we need to ensure that co -"
"ordinated measures be taken, well aware that real effective deterrence to curb acts of domestic "
161 
" violence is realised when such acts are verified, also and especially within civil and juvenile "
"proceedings instituted to settle questions concerning minors. Should their occurrence , also in the "
"forms of assisted violence, be ascertained before these courts, then there should be immediate "
repercussions on questions of parental responsib ility and custody and restraining measures should 
be taken against the violent parent.  
 
On this point the Cartabia reform tends to have a new holistic approach in facing the above 
"problems, setting up a family court to amend the traditional and fractioned  jurisdiction divided "
"between Ordinary Courts and Juvenile Courts (Article 1, paragraph 28, of Law 206/2021) (see below "
point 3.4).  
 
3.3 Institutional changes  
"Women became members of the Judiciary for the first time in 1963, - Law No. 66 of 9 February 1963  "
"- following the repeal of Law 1176 of 1919, which excluded them from public offices with judicial "
"powers, the exercise of political rights and powers, or offices that concerned the State’s military "
defence. The said milestone was late at coming but it allowed a growing number of women to 
become magistrates over the years; so much so that their number has exceeded that of men. 
"However, as is t he case in different sectors, also within the Judiciary there are less women in key "
"positions. In fact, the number of men far exceeds that of women in top positions, from managerial "
posts to the members of the Superior Council of the Judiciary.  
 
"Today  the number of women exceed that of men in the Judiciary . For example, in 2020 there were "
"5,308 women out of a  total of 9,787 (54%) magistrates, while there were 4,479 (46%)men. As at 2 "
"March 2022, there are 9,576 magistrates in Italy, including both magistrates that are placed outside "
"the rolls of magistrates exercising the judicial function for any reason, and o rdinary magistrates "
undergoing a training period (MOT - Magistrati Ordinari in Tirocinio). Gender distribution shows a 
"prevalence of women: 4,293 male magistrates and ,5,283 female magistrates (accounting for some "
55%). The average age of women (49) is low er than that of men (52) by three years. Data clearly 
"shows that although women are over -represented among ordinary magistrates, their number "
"decreases as the importance of the posts increases, from semi -managerial to managerial offices. The "
420 magistrate s holding managerial posts are not uniformly divided between the two genders. In 
"fact, nearly three magistrates out of four (73%) exercising managerial functions are men. Things are "
slightly more balanced in terms of semi -managerial functions (Presidents o f the Divisions). In this 
"case, nearly five out of ten magistrates exercising the said functions are females (45% out of a total "
of 722).  
 
The task of establishing all the roles and posts of magistrates falls under the cognisance of the 
"Superior Council of the Judiciary, the self -governing body of the Italian Judiciary. The Superior "
Council of the Judiciary ensures the autonomy and independence of the Judiciary from any other 
"power. The board is currently made of 27 members, of which 24 a re elected, as established by Law "
"No. 44 of 2022 , and 3 are members by operation of law. Out of the first group, 16 members are "
"professional judges, a nd they are elected by all the ordinary magistrates. The other 8 are lay "
"members, elected by Parliament among university law professors and lawyer that have been "
practising for at least fifteen years. The members by operation of law are the President of th e 
"Republic, who chairs the Superior Council of the Judiciary, the First President of the Supreme Court "
of cassation and the Prosecutor General of the Supreme Court of cassation and the Prosecutor 
General of the Supreme Court of cassation. So far there hasn ’t been any women as members by 
operation of law of the Superior Council of the Judiciary.  As far as the current members of the 
"Council’s board are concerned, it is interesting to note that all the 6 women members have been "
elected by the magistrates and t hat the share of women among professional judges so far is the 
"highest since 1994 (28.6%), while none of the women currently members of the Superior Council of "
"the Judiciary have been elected by Parliament. On the whole, we can say that our Parliament has "
shown to be even more reluctant to elect women within the Superior Council of the Judiciary. The 
162 
 career history of the women elected as members of the Superior Council of the Judiciary shows that 
only three of them have held prior political posts.  
 
On thi s point it is important to underscore that although in order to become a magistrate candidates 
"have to pass a public exam, to advance in one’s career there are also dynamics that go beyond the "
merit. On the one hand there are more women than men as magistr ates (and analysing the history 
"of candidates who passed the exam since 1965, the number of women for the first time exceeded "
"that of men in 1987, when out of the 300 magistrates 156 women passed the exam and became "
"members of the Judiciary). However, in t erms of the leading positions of power, from the presidents "
"of the courts to positions within then Superior Council of the Judiciary, these are predominantly held "
by men (compare https://www.csm.it/web/csm -internet/statistiche/analisi -e-studi/ -
/asset_publisher/39latxhTFMDe/content/donne -in-magistratura?inheritRedirect=false ). A 
magistrate’s network  of relations plays a fundamental role in career advancement and affects the 
choice of the Superior Council of the Judiciary in terms of appointments and posts.  Its discretionary 
power could contribute to hinder the presence of women in decision -making pos itions. That is a 
criticality often underscored by the Association of Italian Women Magistrates (ADMI)  
 
"Lastly, the “Cartabia” reform of the judicial system, passed on 15 June 2022, on the new system for "
electing the 20 (and no longer 16) professional mag istrates members of the Superior Council of the 
"Judiciary, sets forth a new blueprint of the constituencies. There must be not less than 6 candidates "
"for each constituency, and they have to reflect gender equality A candidate integration mechanism "
has been  introduced when there are less than six candidates or the gender ratio is not complied 
with. It consists in drawing  the missing candidates among all eligible magistrates who have not 
previously manifested their unavailability to run. The Supreme Court of cassation on 28 July 2022 
drew the missing women magistrates (39 of them).  
 
"In terms of women in the legal profession, on 24 January 2022, the first woman was elected as "
"president of the National Bar Association (CNF). Furthermore, the “docu -film” presente d by the "
"National Bar Association available on the Cassa Forense YouTube channel, highlights how the gender "
pay-gap within the legal profession is a complex problem: the income gap (average of -40% ) results 
"from the difficulty of women to feel free and enc ouraged to succeed in their profession, to perceive "
"themselves as being endowed with skills and potentialities, not unlike those of their male colleagues. "
"The film wants to “ move the conscience”, to fill the gender gap firstly from a cultural, educational "
"and social, and not only professional, perspective . Within the National Bar Association, efforts have "
focused on two new projects aimed at improving knowledge and skills of lawyers: a social security 
course  for “an informed pension plan” and a professional course for “individual empowerment”.  
 
"From a political perspective, for the first time in history the President of the Senate is a woman, "
while the first woman Speaker of the House goes back to 1979. The electoral law sets 60% as the 
"maximum  percentage for candidates of the same gender in electoral lists, both at the Chamber of "
"Deputies and the Senate. Lists are not accepted when this rule is not complied with (Article 1, "
"paragraph 10e) It is important to keep in mind, however, - that increasi ng the number of women in "
the institutions does not necessarily mean improving their political weight. A yardstick that has been 
"monitored for years is that of the so -called key positions . During the last legislature, 19.23% of key "
positions at the Chamber  of Deputies and 25.58% at the Senate were held by women.  
 
"In terms of companies, the same applies to the members of the board of directors of listed (public) "
"companies, where the imposed presence of women does not mean women holding leadership "
positions. Legislative Decree No 254/2016 - implementing Directive 201 4/95/EU as regards 
disclosure of non -financial and diversity information by certain large undertakings and groups. - has 
amended Article 123 bis of the Consolidated Text on Finance (“Report con corporate governance 
and ownership structure”) introducing the  obligation in the Report on corporate governance and 
"ownership structure, published by listed companies on a yearly basis, to set forth any policies put in "
"place in the matter of diversity in the composition of corporate bodies in terms of age and gender,  "
163 
" and training and career advancement history., as well as a description of the objectives, "
"implementation modalities and outcome of such policies (see Article 123 bis, paragraph 2 d) bis, of "
the Consolidated Text on Finance). These disclosure obligations a re regulated by the so -called 
"“comply or explain ” principle, whereby when a company does not put in place any policy in the "
"matter of diversity, it will have to clearly substantiate the reasons of such a choice (without prejudice "
"to compliance with the pro visions on gender shares). Lastly, Law No.160/2019, paragraph 305, "
provides for CONSOB (Supervisory Body of the Regulated Market) to annually notify to the 
Department for Equal Opportunities of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers the outcome of 
the checks made on the implementation of the new rules on gender shares in listed companies.  
 
"The presence of women in leadership positions in Italian enterprises is on the whole limited, "
"although over the last decade there has been significant progress, in pa rticular in terms of companies "
covered by Law 120/2011. An analysis conducted by CONSOB published last 8 March 2021 
(https://www.conso b.it/documents/46180/46181/20210308_Ossevatorio.pdf/7f31b28d -b53b -
"4cdb -9309 -d30a7ddb7bcc ), showed that the share of women in boards of directors at the beginning "
of the lapse of time taken under consideration was rather low for all types of companies It wa s 22% 
"in capital companies and significantly less in listed companies and banks, where respectively it "
amounted to 7 and 6%. The presence of women in corporate administrative bodies has increased 
"over the years, although differently in the different types of companies. In sectors not bound by "
"gender composition, the share of women in administrative bodies has remained stable (in private "
"companies) or moderately increased (in banks) reaching respectively 24 and 17% in 2019. Rather, in "
terms of listed compani es and publicly controlled companies there has been a considerable increase 
in the number of women in view of the measures introduced by the Golfo -Mosca Law (shares in 
2019 accounted for 37% and 25% respectively). The smaller number of women in the adminis trative 
bodies of publicly controlled companies compared to listed companies is in part due firstly to an 
increase in the number of sole -director companies(38.6% in 2019). In these companies only 10.4% 
"of the CEOs are women, while in companies with a board  of directors women account for 27.4% of "
the directors.  
 
3.4 Research and awareness raising  
"The High School of the Judiciary has provided several courses over time, addressed to the "
"professional updating of magistrates, focusing on gender -based violence  and the risk of secondary "
victimisation of women in the later stage. In the framework of course P21067 delivered in 2021 the 
"findings were that in the majority of prosecutor’s offices, even the best -staffed ones, according to "
"a survey conducted in 2019, ( hence before the introduction of the so -called Red Code Law) crimes "
of violence against women were not prosecuted by magistrates specialised in the field. This led to 
the rise of different practices in the investigation stage. 
(see. https://www.scuolamagistratura.it/web/portalessm/leggi -e-regolamenti/ -
/document_library/UNfqaZviL2by/view_file/2789887  ).  
 
"This is why when Law No. 69 of 2019 (Red Code)  was passed, in the aftermath of the entry into "
"force of the new provisions, several prosecuting offices across Italy adopted and made available "
"their Guidelines, with a view to offering practical advice to practitioners. These doc uments, highly "
"valued by the community of the judiciary and law enforcement authorities, also gain importance "
"among non -experts, prompting observers to focus on multiple aspects of the issue. An authoritative "
"analysis of the amendments introduced by Law No . 69 of 2019 is included in Report No. 62/2019, "
"edited by the Court of Cassation, Ufficio del Massimario.  "
 
"As to criminal law, the Red Code introduces four new crimes in the Criminal Code: disfigurement of "
"a person’s face through permanent injuries (new Article 583 -quinquies of the Criminal Code), "
"punished by imprisonment from 8 to 14 years. When the commission  of this crime results in murder, "
"the penalty is life imprisonment. Still, the reform includes this new type of crime in the list of "
"voluntary crimes giving rise to compensation from the state, the crime unlawful dissemination of "
"images or videos without t he consent of the person depicted (the so -called revenge porn, "
164 
" introduced in Article 612 -ter of the Criminal Code after the crime of stalking), punished by "
"imprisonment from 1 to 6 years and a fine from 5,000 to 15,000 euro; the punishment shall also "
"apply  to anyone who, having received or anyhow acquired the images or videos, disseminates them "
with a view to damaging the persons concerned. The conduct is aggravated if the acts are committed 
"within an emotional relationship, even if ceased, or with the use of computer tools, the offence of "
"coercion or the offence of inducement to marriage (Article 558 -bis of the Criminal Code), punished "
by imprisonment from 1 to 5 years. The conduct is aggravated when the crime is committed to the 
"detriment of minors and is prosecuted when act is committed abroad by, or to the detriment of, an "
Italian national or a foreigner residing in Italy. The offence of violation of removal from the family 
"home and prohibition of approaching places attended by the injured person (Article  387-bis), "
"punished by imprisonment from 6 months to 3 years. Still, with further amendments to the Criminal "
"Code, Law No. 69 of 2019 provides for changes to the crime of mistreatments against family "
"members and cohabitants (Article 572 of the Criminal Cod e) aimed at: tightening the punishment, "
introducing a special aggravated type of offence (punishment increased up to a half) when the 
"offence is committed at the presence of or to the detriment of persons under age, a pregnant "
"woman or a person with disabi lities, or if the fact is committed with weapons, always taking into "
account the minor who witnesses the mistreatment as a person offended by the crime. What’s 
"more, the crime of mistreatments against family members and cohabitants is included in the list of "
"crimes in respect of which the application of preventive measures against suspects is permitted, "
including the prohibition from approaching places attended by persons to be protected. 
"Amendments are also made to crime of persecutory acts: (Article 612 b is of the Criminal Code), by "
"increasing punishments, crimes of sexual violence (Article 609 bis et seq. of the Criminal Code) by "
increasing punishments and extending the time granted to the injured person to file a complaint 
"(from the current 6 months to 1 2 months). Furthermore, the Red Code redefines and tightens the "
aggravating circumstances when sexual violence is committed to the detriment of minors (Article 
609 quater of the Criminal Code) with the provision of an aggravating circumstance (penalty 
increased by up to one third) when the acts are committed with minors under the age of 14 in 
"exchange for money or any other utility, even if only promised. This crime is now prosecutable ex "
"officio, whereas in respect of the crime of murder, the scope of appl ication of aggravating "
"circumstances is broadened by introducing murder aggravated by personal relationships. Finally, by "
"amending Article 165 of the Criminal Code, the Red Code stipulates that the granting of suspended "
sentences for crimes of domestic and  gender -based violence be made conditional on participation 
in specific rehabilitation programmes.  
  
"In addition, Law No. 134 of 27 September 2021 , on Delegation to the Government for the efficiency "
of the justice system in criminal matters as well as in restorative justice and provisions for early 
"settlement of judicial proceedings, in its final stage of implementation, includes provisions on "
criminal protection (substantial and procedural alike) of victims of gender -based violence and marks 
a further ste p towards the long way to adapting domestic legislation to the standards imposed at 
"European level on the protection of gender -based violence (in particular, by Directive No. "
2012/29/UE on aspects of procedural relevance). These provisions also apply the s cope of 
application of the rules introduced by Law No. 69 of 2019 to the victims of crimes provided for in 
attempted form and victims of attempted murder.  
 
"More specifically, the scope of application of a set of procedural guarantees is broadened to inclu de "
all “red flag offences” committed in the attempted form : 1. Article 90 -ter (1 -bis) of the Code of 
"Criminal Procedure, covering notifications on release orders and termination of the custodial "
"security measure, as well as on the escape of the defendant m ade to the victim and relevant defence "
"lawyer, if any (paragraph 11 lett. A); 2. Article 659 (2 bis) of the Code of Criminal Procedure whereby "
"following an order by the supervising judge the release of the person has to be ordered, the public "
"prosecutor in  charge of the execution shall immediately notify, by means of the judicial police, the "
"victim and if appointed, their defence lawyer (paragraph 11, lett. D); 3. Article 362 (1 ter) of the "
Code of Criminal Procedure ruling the taking of information by the public prosecutor from the victim 
"and the person who filed the complaint, claim or petition, within the period of three days from the "
165 
" registration of the crime notice, unless unavoidable needs for the protection of minors under "
"eighteen years of age or the  confidentiality of investigations are in place, also in the interest of "
"victims (paragraph 11, lett. B); 4. Article 370 (2 bis) of the Code of Criminal Procedure whereby "
"judicial police promptly carries out the acts the prosecutor delegated to them (parag raph 11, lett. "
"C); 5. Article 64 bis implementing provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, covering the "
notification of copies of a series of acts laid down therein (paragraph 12) to the civil court for the 
purposes of settling cases on personal separ ation of spouses or proceedings relating to under -age 
children or the exercise of parental responsibility; 6. Article 165 (2) of the of Criminal Code making 
the suspended sentence conditional on participation in specific rehabilitation programmes at 
"instit utions or association engaged in prevention, psychological care and recovery of individuals "
convicted of the same crimes (paragraph 13). In this first group of provisions paragraph 15 should 
also be added: it provides for mandatory arrest for the crime ref erred to in Article 387 bis of the 
"Criminal Code, i.e., for the crime of removal from the family home and the prohibition from "
approaching places attended by the victim.  
 
The Cartabia reform is indeed part of a cultural and social shift towards making gen der equality 
effective.  
 
The Senate report referred to above reads verbatim that “ A careful inquiry of specialised nature to 
ascertain whether domestic violence has taken place in cases of separation with custody or in 
proceedings governing parental respo nsibility stands out among the major criticalities . 
"Unfortunately, the study and in particular the examination of representative cases, has shown that "
too often domestic violence is mistaken for couple conflict and hence mothers victim of violence who 
"prot ect their children from abusive parents are accused of being “alienating parents. Hence, "
"references to non -scientific concepts and unsubstantiated interpretations, that is, not inferred from "
a sound diagnostic path defined and shared by the academic commun ity should be excluded in 
"assessing parenting capacity, in particular any reference and use of the so -called parental alienation "
syndrome (PAS) or parental alienation (PA) or similar concepts should be excluded alike. Corollary to 
this recommendation is th e exclusion of any form of course or treatment inspired by de -
conditioning/conditioning towards minors” . This approach is in line with the one recently indicated 
"by the same Court of Cassation, whereby for the purposes of modifying custody arrangements, th e "
"court on the merits is required to establish the truthfulness of the said conducts, resorting to the "
"common means of evidence, including court experts’ opinions and assumptions, regardless of the "
"abstract evaluation on the scientific validity or invalidi ty of the referred syndrome, taking into "
"account that among the requirements of parental eligibility, the ability to preserve the continuity of "
"parental relations with the other parent is also relevant, in order to protect the child’s right to co -"
"parenting  and balanced and harmonious upbringing (Cass. Division 1, Order No. 13217 of 17 May "
2021).  
 
3.5 Other pertinent developments  
"In implementing European Directive No. 2012/29/EU establishing minimum standards on the rights, "
"support and protection of victims of crime, the Ministry of Justice set an inter -institutional working "
"group to discuss “general services” to support all victim s of crime, which includes among its "
"participants besides the Department for Justice Affairs in its capacity as co -ordinator, the "
"Department for Juvenile and Community Justice, representatives of the National Forensic Council, "
"the State -Region Conference, the Ministry of the Interior, the third sector - Dafne Network - and "
"Roma Tre University. In 2021, the Regions and the autonomous provinces of Trento and Bolzano "
"were invited, also in consortium or partnership form, to submit “ad hoc project proposals for the "
"development of public services to provide support to the victims of crime, also in a complementary "
and integrated form with the already introduced or submitted measures in the framework of the 
regional/provincial planning and possibly in line of contin uity” with those already put in place by 
"the Cassa delle Ammende. 1,914,969.90 euros have been allocated to the 11 Regions having "
submitted relevant projects. The use of resources already allotted to Regions is currently subject to 
"scrutiny. In 2022, on 18  July 2022 a call for proposals was published on the Ministry of Justice "
166 
 website to implement public services for the support of victims of any types of crime and the 
"promotion of restorative justice programmes. The amount allocated is 1,508,503.01 euros. "
"Restorative justice was included, in line with the choices made by lawmakers on criminal delegation, "
on top of the transposition of European Directive no. 2012/29/EU.  
 
This Agreement aims at co -ordinating the measures put in place for the protection of the  victims of 
crime and the development of programmes of restorative justice and establish a service network to 
meet the needs of victims of crime and ensure uniform qualitative standards in the delivery of 
"services by the administration of justice, though a ctions intended to:  "
A) monitoring the initiatives aimed at establishing and strengthening services for the protection of 
"victims of crime and the development of restorative justice, already funded by the parties with the "
"respective budgetary funds, ensuri ng that services be delivered uniformly across the country;  "
B) co -ordinating measures aimed at establishing and strengthening services for the protection of 
"victims of crime and for the development restorative justice, which have already been funded by "
the parties;  
C) identify and make arrangement for the delivery of integrated training courses for practitioners 
to facilitate the development of a network of services aimed at supporting victims of crime and 
delivering restorative justice actions to ensure uniform quality standards in the delivery of services 
by the administration of justice;  
"D) promote raising awareness campaigns, including through the involvement of education institutes "
"and universities in the forms prescribed by law, on the protection of  victims and prevention of "
"violent behaviour, as well as initiatives aimed at seeking restorative justice practices in the "
settlement of disputes;  
E) develop information campaigns to promote funding initiatives and making “ Re-Agire Portal ” 
"known to the pu blic, the first national portal providing information and support for victims of any "
"type of crimes, in co -operation with Roma Tre University and the National Research Centre - "
Institute of Legal Informatics and Judicial Systems.  
 
"The website offers, thou ght its pages, targeted information and guidance, directing visitors to clear "
"and accessible paths to assistance services provided across the national territory. Thus, the website "
is meant to be a national hub for information. All contents made available t o users should make it 
possible to: raise the overall awareness of the forms of protection available to all the subjects falling 
"within the scope of the legislation at issue, provide the basic information to effectively exercise the "
"referred forms of prote ction, also by simplifying their participation in any proceedings, provide a "
"comprehensive overview of the avenues - judicial and not - that the victims may be involved in, so "
as to offer a clear scenario of the options that may be available and make likel y predictions as to 
"the possible outcome, help liaise with organisations - both public and private - across Italy, also with "
"a view to facilitating access to victim support service (Article 8, Directive 2012/29/EU), introduce "
"victims to the specific assist ance services reserved, free of charge and active in the territory, before, "
"during and for an adequate period of time after the conclusion of the criminal proceedings, direct "
"the victim who suffered a crime abroad to manage emerging situations, if any, and  the resulting "
"obligations, both in the territory of the country where they are temporarily staying and upon their "
"return to Italy, provide an information hub to locate the different type of specialists who come in "
"contact with the victim in various capaci ties throughout the proceeding, also with a view to filling "
"any gaps in individual training, improve the interaction between victim and competent authorities "
"from the first contacts, thus helping to streamline access to justice and reduce any form of inter -"
ethnic injustice and avert the risk of secondary victimisation.  
 
"No matter how the Agreement is aimed at protecting all victims of crime, is it clear that the system "
"put in place to strengthen preventive and restorative protection tools, will largely bene fit women "
victims of gender -based violence.  
 
4. Strategic objective: Achieve balanced participation of women and men in political and public 
decision -making  
167 
  
4.1 Legislative changes  
"As for actions to promote fundamental rights and freedoms, particular attention has been paid in "
recent years to interventions aimed at implementing Article 51 of the Constitution on equal access 
"of women and men to elected positions, by affecting the electoral systems at the different levels "
"(national, regional, local and E uropean Parliament).  "
 
"In the last legislative cycles, the Italian Parliament has approved regulatory measures aimed at "
"promoting gender balance at the local, regional, national and European levels (Law No. 215/2012 "
for municipal elections; Law No. 56/2014 for elections - at the second level - of metropolitan and 
provincial councils; Law No. 20/2016 for elections to regional councils; Law No. 165/2017 for 
elections to Parliament; Law No. 65/2014 for Italian representation in the European Parliament). 
Measure s promoting equal opportunities have also been introduced in the most recent measures 
concerning the regulation of political parties.  
 
4.2 Policy changes   
"The National Strategy for Gender Equality 2021 -2026, already mentioned, starting from data "
"analysis , focuses on the following five strategic priorities: work, income, skills, time, power. For each "
"of the priorities, the Strategy defines interventions to be taken (including measures of a cross -cutting "
"nature), as well as related indicators (aimed at meas uring the main aspects of gender inequality) and "
targets (specific and measurable objectives to be achieved). The indicators and targets serve to guide 
governmental action and monitor the effectiveness of measures implemented.  
 
"These measures have been and  will be implemented by the central Administrations, Regions and "
"Local Authorities, on the basis of their institutional competences, taking into account the reference "
sector and the nature of the intervention. The Conference of the Regions and the Union of  Provinces 
and Municipalities will also be permanently involved.  
 
In particular the Strategy is aimed at pursuing the following goals:  
- identifying good practices to combat gender stereotypes;  
- closing the gender gap in the labour market;  
- achieving equality in participation in different economic sectors;  
- addressing the pay and pension gap;  
- achieving gender balance in decision -making.  
 
The long -term goal of the Strategy is to gain 5 points in the ranking of the EIGE Gender Equality Index 
"in the ne xt 5 years, to rank better than the European average by 2026, with the aim of being among "
the top 10 European countries in 10 years.  
 
"Funding provides an increase of EUR 5 million, starting from the year 2022, in the Fund for Rights "
and Equal Opportunities  Policies.  
 
4.3 Institutional changes  
"As already mentioned, in order to strengthen the governance of the 2021 -2026 Strategy, the 2022 "
"Budget Law (Article 1, paragraphs 139 -148, Law No. 234/2021) has provided for the establishment "
at the Department for Equal Opportunities of an inter -institutional Steering Committee and a 
National Observatory for the integration of gender equality policies.  
 
4.4 Research and awareness raising  
"As already mentioned, by Decree of 22 April 2021 the Minister for Equal Oppo rtunities and the "
Family set up a Working Group at the Department for Equal Opportunities on issues relating to the 
rebalancing of gender representation in institutions and the revision of appointment and election 
168 
" procedures, as well as to support the eval uation of measures introduced to protect equal "
opportunities.  
 
"The WG, composed of nine university professors in the fields of constitutional law, public law and "
"comparative public law, was assigned the task of carrying out in -depth studies and drafting "
"proposals, including legislative ones, aimed at rebalancing gender representation in institutions and "
revising appointment and election procedures.  
 
The outcomes of the WG are provided in a Working Paper published on 1 December 2021.  
 
"5. Strategic objective: Protect the rights of migrant, refugee and asylum -seeking women and girls  "
 
5.2 Policy changes  
"Due to the strong linkage between the conditions of migrant, refugee and asylum -seeking women "
"and girls and their higher risk to be victims of exploi tation and trafficking, the new National Anti -"
Trafficking Action Plan (NAP) 2022 -2025 is worth of mentioning.  
 
The Plan aims to define 'multi -year intervention strategies for preventing and combating the 
"phenomenon of trafficking and the severe exploitatio n of human beings, as well as actions aimed at "
"awareness raising, social prevention, emergence, and social integration of victims.  "
 
"With this goal, the Minister for Equal Opportunities and the Family presents NAP to the Council of "
"Ministers, granting the continuity of government action on combating the phenomenon of human "
trafficking.  
 
The strategic objective of the new NAP is to improve - according to a uniform approach at the 
"European level - the national response to the phenomenon of trafficking, acting  with respect for "
"human rights and the principle of non -discrimination, according to a gender mainstreaming "
"perspective, the protection of the rights of minors, women and more generally of vulnerable groups.  "
 
"With the Plan's operational actions, the Depart ment for Equal Opportunities intends to provide "
positive and concrete responses to the priority strategic objectives for the three years 2022 -2025 by 
identifying appropriate interventions and resources to combat the phenomenon; implementing 
initiatives and  good practice policies in continuity with what has been carried out under the previous 
"Plan; seeking to provide increasingly victim -oriented responses, in line with European "
recommendations on the issue.  
 
"The elaboration of the NAP has been set up in cohe rence with the four guidelines on which, at the "
"international level, strategies for combating human trafficking are based, namely prevention, "
"prosecution, protection, partnership (prevention, prosecution of crime, protection, and social "
"integration, co -operation).  "
 
"In addition, it is also of fundamental importance to strengthen the co -operation between the "
"institutional level and the private social sector, which is an indefectible element in the construction "
"of the Italian strategy, to maintain and strength en the integrated public and private networks "
"operating in the territories, oriented to the so -called ""multi -agency work"".  "
 
In the context of the implementation of EM.as.com  (Empowerment Asylum Commission) project  – 
"signed by the National Asylum Commission with the European Commission, started on 1  September "
2019 with the partnership of UNHCR – launched on 1 September 2019 with the priority aim of 
"strengthening the National Asylum system, the Sub -Actions 6 and 7 of th e project provide activities "
for the implementation of co -ordination mechanisms in order to enhance the identification of 
victims of gender -based violence (Action 6) and of trafficking (Action 7) among asylum -seekers and 
169 
 to facilitate referral mechanisms b etween the Territorial Commissions (TCs) and the organisations 
specialised in providing assistance and protection to victims.  
 
"In the framework of sub-action 6 , the development of good practices was envisaged through the "
"realisation of standard operating procedures (SOPs), addressed to TC’s staff for the correct "
"identification and referral  of potential victims of gender -based violence, published in December "
"2021  and presented in a national online event on 31 March 2022, now available at the link "
http://www.libertaciviliimmigrazione.dlci.interno.gov.it/it/documentazione/pubblicazioni/pubblica
te-procedure -operative -standard -lemersione -e-referral -delle   
 
The SOP’s facilitate TC’s staff to recognise potential GBV survivors among asylum seekers with  a set 
of indicators and promote the activation of a standard referral procedure between Territorial 
"Commissions and anti -violation associations, in order to facilitate the awareness by applicants of "
"their victim status and to allow, through a reporting me chanism, the establishment of contact "
between the victim and the assistance and protection services on the territory.  
 
In order to implement SOPs NAC and UNHCR carried on several training activities with TC’s and 
monitoring missions.  
 
"Furthermore, in May 2022 NAC started the data collection of the potential victim of gender -based "
"violence identified by TCs in the first of the year 2022, with the detail of gender, nationality, age, "
form of violence. The data collection will be periodically repeated in order  to collect updated data.  
 
"On 20 December 2021 the Ministry of Interior, Department of Civil Liberties and Immigration, signed "
"a Memorandum of Understanding  with the following women associations: Rete per le Parita, Le "
"Contemporanee, il Consiglio Nazionale Donne Italiane, Soroptimist International. The agreement, "
"aimed at supporting women fleeing Afghanistan and their families, remained active until 30 June.  "
  
"In 2022, the work of the Vulnerability Working Group continues. Members of the group are "
"representatives from the Central Directorate of Civil Services for Immigration and Asylum, the "
"Ministry of Health, The National Institute for Health, Migration and P overty (NIHMP), Red Cross, the "
"Central Service for the Management of SAI, the International Agencies UNHCR, IOM and UNICEF, "
"EUAA, and the NGO Doctors Without Borders (MSF). In addition, the group includes the participation "
of institutions involved in the h otspot standard operating procedures (Department of Public 
"Security, Harbour Master and Guardia di Finanza Command, Frontex, Europol) and the European "
Commission. The first main output of the working group is a Vademecum containing information 
"and procedur es for the detection, referral and care of vulnerable persons, included women and girls. "
The Vademecum will be available and disseminated among all the operators involved in the 
reception of people arriving on Italian territory.  
 
Adoption of the National Plan for UAMs (March 2022): the plan aims to provide guidelines for the 
management of unaccompanied minors who arrived in the national territory as a result of the war 
in Ukraine. The national plan has been updated and expanded with a component dedicated t o the 
management of possible phenomena of disappearance and to anti -trafficking prevention activities.  
 
5.3 Institutional changes  
"At the national level, the Plan's governance structure is articulated as follows:  "
- a Steering Committee which involves competent political authorities and all central and local 
administrations involved on the issue of trafficking and serious exploitation of human beings;  
- a Technical Committee supporting the Steering Committee for the drafting and implementation of 
the Na tional Action Plan against trafficking and serious exploitation of human beings.  
 
"The co -ordinating role of the national level is ensured by the Department for Equal Opportunities,  "
It is foreseen to set up tables or working groups to examine specific issue s in depth.  
170 
  
Considering that the cross -cutting nature of the public competencies involved covers the multiple 
"levels of government, the Plan must pursue the path of empowerment and involvement - particularly "
in the protection of victims - of territorial authorities as  proximity authorities concerning the 
"management of the phenomenon and as holders of structural fund resources that can, in a "
"complementary way, enhance the national resources made available.  "
 
"Also, the National Anti -Trafficking Observatory, set up by the  Department for Equal Opportunities, "
operates as an observation and monitoring body to assess the phenomenon in a constant and up -
"to-date manner, supporting policies to prevent and combat trafficking and contributing to the "
planning of operational strategi es to be translated into positive and concrete actions.  
 
"During 2022, the Department of Civil Liberties and Immigration continued updating and enhancing "
the tools developed to monitor the quality of the services provided in reception centres. DCLI - with 
the support of EUAA - is working on the drafting of questionnaires in digital format that will facilitate 
the work of Prefectures and the Ministry of the Interior in the management and monitoring of the 
reception system.  
 
"In line with national legislation a nd Directive 2013/33/EU on reception, the questionnaires are "
hinged on a series of indicators aimed at defining the quality of the provided services and goods also 
"considering gender diversity. Moreover, the questionnaires will contain an indicator specifi cally "
"dedicated to vulnerabilities, including for the purpose of assessing specific conditions of fragility, "
including sexual and gender -based violence.  
 
5.4 Research and awareness raising  
"The implementation of the Plan could further count upon the Anti -Trafficking Helpline (800 290 290), "
"established in 2000 by the Department for Equal Opportunities, active 24 hours a day, 365 days a "
"year, free of charge, anonymous and allowing contact with multilingual specialised personnel.  "
 
"In addition to its emersion and reporting functions, the toll -free number also performs a public "
"management and data collection activity by holding and developing information, and is now "
"increasingly committed, in a third -party position with respect to ongoing projects, to carrying out "
"systemic action, collecting particularly those data and interventions through the SIRIT ( Sistema "
"Informatizzato per la raccolta di informazioni sulla tratta ) system, following the recom mendations "
from GRETA and the monitoring bodies of the Council of Europe and other international bodies such 
as OSCE. The SIRIT system is fed by data of the entities owners/implementers of the assistance and 
"social protection projects for victims of traffi cking and exploitation, co -financed by the Department "
for Equal Opportunities pursuant to Article 18 of Legislative Decree No. 286/1998 and Article 13 of 
Law No. 228/2003.  
 
"In the framework of the above mentioned EMAS project, sub -action 6, NAC and UNHCR d eveloped "
information materials on GBV (flyers and posters in five languages) to be share in TC’s locals in order 
to facilitate the awareness by applicants of their victim status and to give an immediate help to those 
who are in danger (anti -violence number  1522 managed by Department for Equal Opportunity). The 
flyers are online available at the link

"The National Asylum Commission – Ministry of the Interior constantly promotes several activities, in "
order to implement best practices within the asylum system.  
 
In the context of the competence of the National Asylum Commission to promote constantly and to 
"co-ordinate the training and refreshing courses for Territorial Commissions’ members, several "
training activities are focused on thematic issues in order to:  
171 
  
"1- facilitate the prompt identification of victims of trafficking, also enhancing a referral mec hanism "
between TCs and the anti -trafficking projects;  
"2- improve members’ territorial Commissions expertise, skills and techniques in interviewing "
"minors, LGBTI and vulnerable persons among asylum seekers.  "
 
"In fact, every year, in collaboration with EUAA , an high number of courses are organised on relevant "
"issues, even using EUAA modules such as: “Trafficking in Human Beings”, “Gender, Gender Identity "
and Sexual Orientation” “Interviewing Children” and “Interviewing Vulnerable persons”.  
 
"Moreover, in the co ntext of the activities carried on by NAC in collaboration with UNHCR in the "
"framework of the project EM.as .com,  specific training activities  on GBV and monitoring missions "
were held in the first part of 2022 in order to implement the SOPs recently publish ed and to promote 
the start of co -operation between TCs and anti -violence associations.  
 
In order to ensure the capacity of a timely assessment of persons with special needs within the 
"reception system, through the collaboration of UNHCR, UNICEF and IOM, a  thematic training has "
been prepared for the benefit of those working in the asylum reception system (first -line reception 
"facilities and hotspot). The online training includes several thematic and in -depth contents, such as:  "
"- general notions on internati onal protection and access to services for refugees and asylum seekers, "
"unaccompanied foreign minors and persons with special needs, including vulnerability identification "
and referral procedures;  
- knowledge on how to provide initial support to survivors  of gender -based violence . 
 
The initiative has been drawn to the attention of all the Prefectures with Circular letter No. 36236 
of 19 November 2021 requesting to promote it among staff working in reception centres. The e -
learning course will remain availa ble throughout 2022.  
 
"In April 2022, to support people fleeing war in Ukraine, 2 support centres (Blue Dot) for minors, "
"women, families and people with special needs were opened in Friuli Venezia Giulia, at the Fernetti "
(Trieste) and Tarvisio (Udine) bord er crossings. The Blue Dots are safe places where specialised staff 
provide legal information and orientation to the services available on the Italian territory and 
"provide support in case of gender -based violence and to potential victims of trafficking. M oreover, "
first psycho -social support is offered to children and to those in need. The project is implemented 
"by UNHCR, UNICEF, Save the Children, Stella Polare, Di.Re (Women Network Against Violence), ARCI, "
in co -ordination with the Italian Border Authorit ies. 
 
6. Strategic objective: Achieve gender mainstreaming in all policies and measures  
 
6.1 Legislative changes   
"By Legislative Decree No. 116 of 12 September 2018, No. 116 gender budgeting was strengthened, "
emphasising that this tool should be used as an information basis to promote gender equality 
"through public policies, giving greater transparency in the allocation of resources and carrying out "
an analysis of the effects of these policies according to gender and redefining and reallocating 
"resources accordingly, in line with fair and sustainable welfare indicators (BES) included in the "
Economic and Financial Document (DEF).  
 
In the fifth edition of the Report to the Italian Parliament on Gender Budgeting of 27 December 2021 
it is highlighted that inte rventions aimed at reducing gender gaps adopted in 2020 through the 
Budget Law and related measures mainly concern the reconciliation of private and working life and 
"the fight against gender -based violence, but there are also several measures related to: l abour "
"protection, welfare and assistance, maternity protection and support, participation in economic, "
"political and administrative decision -making processes, education and interventions against gender "
172 
" stereotypes, health, lifestyle and safety, and the lab our market. Some measures were adopted ex "
"novo , while others are an extension of previous measures.  "
 
"Moreover, as of 8 March 2021 the Study Service of the Chamber of Deputies of the Italian Parliament "
started a pilot gender impact analysis as a key-document to be included in the dossiers on bills 
"examined by the Chamber itself, precisely requesting 'to evaluate the opportunity to provide, on an "
"experimental and selective basis, within the documentation dossiers prepared by the Study Service, "
"on d raft laws under consideration by the permanent commissions, the drafting of a paragraph "
dedicated to gender impact analysis'.  
 
Among the challenges concerning the gender budgeting functioning there are the following ones:  
- integrate gender budgeting into a strategic framework of gender equality goals and to this scope 
the issue has been included in the first National Strategy for Gender Equality 2021 -2026;  
 
- consolidating gender budgeting by moving beyond the current pilot and integrating the gender 
"persp ective (gender mainstreaming) into the budgeting process, thus enhancing its potential impact. "
"From this point of view, in the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) one of the targets of "
the reform concerning the spending review stipulates that the 2024 Budget Law should introduce a 
classification of the planned items according to criteria underpinning the Sustainable Development 
"Goals and the 2030 Agenda, with regard to gender budgeting and environmental budgeting.   "
 
6.2 Policy changes  
The National Strategy for Gender Equality 2021 -2026 is inspired by an holistic mainstreaming 
approach. The ambition defines in a quantitative and measurable way the overall goal in terms of 
"progress on gender equality, using the ranking as calculated by EIGE a nd the score given to each "
European country following the assessment of multiple dimensions in line with the five strategic 
priorities of the Strategy. This ambition defines a global goal in terms of total score ( «gain 5 points 
"«) and a specific goal with  respect to other European countries, both within the Strategy's timeframe "
( «to outperform the European average by 2026 «) and in subsequent years ( «to be among the top 
"10 in 10 years «). In fact, the Strategy intends to outline initiatives that will lea d to a significant "
improvement for the country and reaffirm its leading role at European level.  
 
"The NRRP envisages interventions aimed at implementing the principle of gender equality, not "
"forgetting, at the same time, to enhance education and support for  families.  "
 
"Specifically, the Plan implements the principle of gender equality along two different levels, e.g., the "
implementation of specific and cross -cutting actions. As for the latter ones measures to improve 
childcare services are of particular impor tance. Specific actions include the introduction of gender 
"equality certification, the creation of women's enterprises, the provision of 0 -6 education services "
as well as the STEM projects.  
 
"In addition, a series of conditionalities for companies are intro duced, aimed at encouraging the "
hiring of women and young people.  
 
"Moreover, the Plan provides for the introduction of additional measures in the calls for tenders, in "
"the form of additional points, to be awarded to those economic operators that guarantee the "
adoption of measures aimed at meeting the aforementioned equality requirements.  
 
6.3 Institutional changes  
"As already mentioned, in order to strengthen the governance of the 2021 -2026 Strategy, the 2022 "
"Budget Law (Article 1, Paragraphs 139 -148, Law  No. 234/2021) provided the establishment at the "
Department for Equal Opportunities of an inter -institutional Steering Committee and a National 
Observatory for the Integration of Gender Equality Policies.  
173 
  
7. Main challenges and lessons learned  
 
 
"Among the most relevant aspects, addressed through a positive policy approach, the following ones "
should be mentioned:  
 
- data and evidence from periodic statistical surveys on different sectoral issues;  
- indications coming from various supranational systems concerning equal opportunities through 
legislative and regulatory instruments to be implemented at the national level.  
 
"With regard to these measures, it is important to underline their complementary relevance for the "
definition of national policies and in terventions to concretely promote gender equality: all 
"quantitative contextualisation processes, also in order to identify the problems inherent to women's "
"working conditions and the need to harmonise working and living times, allows for a preventive "
asses sment of the impact of national and local legislative measures with a view to targeted 
intervention to overcome critical issues.  
 
"In the definition of its policies, the Department for Equal Opportunities has always promoted an "
approach aimed at involving a  plurality of stakeholders in order to feed broad and participatory 
processes for the development of interventions and shared actions to promoting equal 
"opportunities, women's empowerment and combating gender -based discrimination.  "
 
The establishment of Ste ering Committees and Working Groups has been an useful tool to promote 
a constant dialogue with stakeholders for example for the definition and implementation of the 
National Plan on Male Violence against Women or the National Action Plan against Trafficki ng. All 
bodies have ensured the adoption of a multidisciplinary approach in the drafting of their respective 
"policies, encompassing both public and private actors.  "
 
To this scope the Call of expression of interest issued by the Department for Equal Opport unities in 
July 2020 was structured to identify at national level associations engaged in the promotion of equal 
"opportunities and gender equality and in activities to counter gender -based discrimination, in order "
to draw up an agenda of interventions and actions for women's empowerment and to submit 
proposals for the promotion of equal opportunities and gender equality. Following the conclusion 
"of the Call, all the associations that took part in it were included in a special Register, which allows "
"the Depa rtment, among other things, to transmit any useful information to their attention and to "
"receive adequate feedback, where there is a participatory dialogue requiring the direct involvement "
of civil society.  
 
  
174 
 Latvia  
 
1. Strategic objective: Prevent and combat gender stereotypes and sexism  
 
1.4 Research and awareness raising  
Ministry of Welfare in co -operation with NGO “Centre MARTA” in October 2022 organised 
workshops and discussions for young people on how to build non -violent and respectful 
relations hips  based on the principle of gender equality. Four workshops for young people aged 15 
"to 19 were held in different cities of Latvia, during which, with the help of informal education "
"methods, youth mentors from “Centre MARTA” talked about healthy relatio nship building, harmful "
gender stereotypes and how to recognise discrimination and violent behaviour in a relationship.  
 
2. Strategic objective: Prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence  
 
2.1 Legislative changes .  
"On 17 February 2022, amendments to the law “On Police” came into force, which allow police "
officers to take a decision to separate a person who poses a threat from a victim without a written 
"application of the victim.  Additionally, police officers inform municipal social  service institutions in "
all cases where the risk of violence threats has been identified whether or not a police decision on 
"the separation is taken (for example, if the risk of violence has been identified, but the protected "
person refuses to write an ap plication so that the police can take a decision on the separation). Until 
"this, a police officer could take a decision on separation only on the basis of a written application of "
the victim of domestic violence.  
 
The Ministry of Justice  at the end of 202 2 will organise a discussion at the Permanent Working Group 
on the Criminal Law with an aim to review possible overlap of the Criminal law sections 164 
"(involvement into prostitutions), 165.1 (sending for sexual exploitation), 166 parts 3, 4 and 5 "
(pornogr aphy). The aim of the assessment is to understand if it is necessary to change some 
formulation of these sections in order to better strengthen prosecutions and convictions related to 
"trafficking in human beings. For example, these sections have regulation  on the involvement of "
"minors in prostitutions, thus assessing if these case should be qualified as trafficking in human "
beings.  
 
This task has been initiated pursuant to the GRETA (the Group of Experts on Action against 
Trafficking in Human Beings) recom mendation raised already in the first evaluation round [para 169 
and 170]  
(https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMCont ent?documentId=0900
001680631cbc ).  
 
2.2 Policy changes  
The new Action Plan Against Trafficking in human beings 2021 – 2023 was adopted on 28 September 
2021  
(https://likumi.lv/ta/id/326420 -par-cilveku -tirdzniecibas -noversanas -planu -2021 -2023 -gadam ).  
 
For the period in 2022 it is important to mention an overa rching national plan to support the people 
fleeing form the war in Ukraine ( https://likumi.lv/ta/id/332025 -par-pasakumu -planu-atbalsta -
sniegsanai -ukrainas -civiliedzivotajiem -latvijas -republika ). This plan also enclosed some action 
"related to prevention and early detection of possible cases of trafficking in human beings, in "
"particular, the awareness rising leaflets for people entering from Ukraine, and the procedures on "
early detection general prevention of trafficking in human beings among people fleeing from the 
war in Ukraine were included in the plan. Activities related to trafficking in human beings have been 
already imple mented.  
 
175 
 2.4 Research and awareness raising  
On 19 August 2022 the Central Statistical Bureau of Latvia published the results of a survey  
"conducted in 2021 on personal safety and exposure to undesirable behaviour in the workplace, "
"society, partnerships, family and childhood.  Data showed that every fourth woman (25.1%) and "
every fifth man (19.5%) aged 18 -74 in Latvia have experienced physical or sexual violence. Survey 
"also showed that every third (30.1%) woman has experienced psychological, physical or sexual "
violence or a combination of several forms of violence while in a relationship. This is the first time 
such a surve y has been conducted in Latvia and the data obtained will help to create a more 
comprehensive understanding about the current situation and to develop more targeted support 
mechanisms for victims of violence.  
 
In November 2022 Ministry of Welfare launched an information campaign on psychological 
violence called “Psychological Violence – Invisible but Real” . The aim of the campaign is to draw 
public attention to the devastating impact of psychological violence in family relationships. It is 
essential to promote a common understanding of the phenomenon of psychological violence and to 
"encourage victims to seek help. Campaign consists of various media activities (posters, video "
"advertisements on social media and on state TV and radio, as well as informative opinion pieces on "
psychological violence – how to recognise it and where to seek help) and it will continue until 16 
December 2022.  
 
The Ministry of Interior of Latvia  is carrying out two projects that are contributing to the reduction 
"to trafficking in human beings, including as regards exploitation of women and girls.  "
 
"In project CAPE “Competence building, Assistance provision and Prosecution of labour Exploitation "
cases in the Baltic Sea region”  in 2021 the ministry of the interior of Latvia procured an evaluation 
"of the transnational referral mechanisms of trafficking in human beings. In particular, assessing the "
needs of professi onals and victims who refer from one country to another. As the result of this 
"evaluation, it is planned to do necessarily improvements for the Transnational Referral Mechanism "
of the Baltic Sea Region. The results will also contribute to safer internation al referral of women and 
girls.

labour -exploitation -cases -in-the-baltic -sea-region -cape   
 
The second project ELECT THB “Enhanced Law Enforcement Co -operation and Training on 
Trafficking in Human Beings”  aims to strengthen co -operation of law enforcement and other 
controlling institutions to detect and stop cases of labour exploitation and sexual exploitation. In 
"2022, three member of the project – Estonia, Finland and Latvia – are doing the research on t he "
modus operandi in organisation of trafficking in these countries. To have broader perspective of the 
"situation, another research is also done in Poland by the organisation La Strada. In addition, project "
partners collect information on the best practice s in detection and investigation THB cases. On a 
"basis of the research, a new training model for investigators, prosecutors and judges will be "
"developed and carried about with a number of trainings in Finland, Estonia and Latvia. Besides, an "
international workshop dedicated to the topic of trafficking of human beings for the purposes for

 Luxembourg  
 
1. Objectif stratégique: prévenir et combattre les stéréotypes de genres et le sexisme  
 
1.1 changements législatifs   
"En juin 2022, la ministre de la Justice luxembourgeoise a déposé un projet de loi ayant pour objet "
d’introduire dans le Code Pénal une circonstance aggravante pour un fait qualifié de crime ou de 
"délit commis au motif d’une des caractéristiques visées à l’ article 454 du Code pénal, à savoir d’une "
"distinction opérée entre les personnes physiques à cause de (entre autres) de leur sexe, de leur "
"orientation sexuelle, de leur changement de sexe, de leur identité de genre.  "
 
"La reconnaissance de ces caractéristiq ues, protégées comme circonstance aggravante d’un crime ou "
"délit commis pour un motif fondé sur l’une ou l’autre d’entre elles, s’inscrit dans le cadre des "
recommandations émises par la Commission européenne dans la Stratégie européenne de lutte 
"contre l’a ntisémitisme et de soutien à la vie juive, afin de pouvoir poursuivre, notamment, les crimes "
de haine antisémites. Le Conseil de l’UE s’est exprimé dans le même sens le 2 mars 2022 en adoptant 
"les «Conclusions on Combating Racism and Antisemitism». Par ail leurs, le Luxembourg répond ainsi "
à la recommandation de l’ECRI (European Commission against Racism and Intolerance) de mettre 
son droit pénal en conformité en prévoyant expressément que la motivation raciste et 
homo/transphobe constitue une circonstance a ggravante pour toute infraction de droit commun. 
Le texte s’inscrit encore dans le cadre du projet de décision du Conseil de l’Union européenne visant 
à inclure les discours de haine et les crimes de haine sur la liste des infractions européennes de 
l’arti cle 83§1 du TFUE en vue de promouvoir les valeurs fondamentales de l’UE et de faire respecter 
la charte des droits fondamentaux de l’UE.  
 
La généralité de la disposition a pour objet d’indiquer que toutes les formes et manifestations de 
"haine et d’intolér ance sont incompatibles avec les valeurs sur lesquelles l’UE est fondée, à savoir le "
"respect de la dignité humaine, la liberté, la démocratie, l’égalité, l’État de droit et le respect des "
"droits de l’Homme, y compris les droits des personnes appartenant à des minorités, de sorte qu’elles "
"ont vocation à être incriminées quel que soit leur vecteur infractionnel. La circonstance, suivant "
laquelle le fait qualifié crime ou délit a été commis en raison d’une ou plusieurs caractéristiques 
"visées à l’article 454 d u Code pénal portant ainsi une atteinte plus grande à la cohésion sociale, est "
de nature à justifier une élévation de la pénalité encourue par l’introduction d’une circonstance 
aggravante.  
 
1.4 recherche et sensibilisation  
 Dans le cadre d’une coopération triennale (2019 -2022) entre le ministère de l’Egalité entre 
"les femmes et les hommes et l’Université du Luxembourg, la chercheuse Miriam -Linnea Hale "
a finalisé son projet de thèse doctorale intitulée «From Stereotypes to Hos tile Sexism - A 
Psychological Analysis of Conceptions about Gender»  sous la direction de M. Prof. Dr. André 
Melzer. C’est une grande première qu’une telle analyse scientifique approfondie a été 
réalisée au Luxembourg sur le sujet de l’influence des stéréot ypes sexués sur notre société. 
L’étude a fait l’objet d’une présentation thématique au sein de la Commission pour l’égalité 
du genre du Conseil de l’Europe lors de la réunion du 11 au 13 mai 2022.  
 
 Le ministère de l’Egalité entre les femmes et les hommes est en outre en train de réaliser sa 
prochaine campagne de sensibilisation sur le sexisme en se basant sur la campagne du 
"Conseil de l’Europe «  Sexisme  : Vois -le, dis -le, stoppons -le ! », le lancemen t étant prévu en "
novembre 2022.

2. Objectif stratégique: prévenir et combattre la violence contre les femmes et la violence 
domestique  
 
2.4 recherche et sensibilisation  
 Le Conseil National des Femmes du Luxembourg (CNFL) – organisation partenaire 
conventionnée avec le ministère de l’Egalité - organise annuellement en novembre ladite 
« Orange Week  » à l’occasion de la Journée Internationale de la lutte contre la violence à 
"l’égard des femmes et des filles. Dans le cadre de cette initiative, beaucoup  de bâtiments "
publics et privés sont illuminés en couleur orange afin de se solidariser avec ce mouvement 
qui a été initialement lancé par UN Women. L’  « Orange Week  » (25.11.2021 -10.12.2021) a 
"été flanquée par d’autres évènements tels que des conférences,  des actions de rue ainsi que "
par la grande «  Marche Orange  » du 20 novembre 2021 à Esch/Alzette (2e ville du Grand -
Duché de Luxembourg). Le ministère de l’Egalité s’est rallié à l’Orange Week à travers certains 
projets  finalisés en 2021  :  
 
 la refonte fon damentale du site  www.violence.lu  une plateforme d’information digitale pour 
"victimes, auteur -e-s, et témoins de violence domestique  "
 la réalisation de la «  Tutenak tioun  » (action sachets boulangerie) avec les boulangeries 
Fischer et Jos & Jean -Marie pour sensibiliser le grand public en matière de violence 
domestique  
" le développement de projets innovateurs, tels que le théâtre de prévention (avec l’Ecole du "
"Théâtre),  le « Violentomètre » (questionnaire «  relation2test  » avec la FMPO) ou encore le "
projet « E Schrëtt géint Gewalt » (avec Inter -Actions) pour sensibiliser et informer le grand 
public  
 la campagne de prévention contre les violences domestiques s’adressant aux auteur(e)s 
développée par le service Riicht Eraus de la Croix -Rouge luxembourgeoise  
 la coopération avec le Centre Hospitalier Emile Mayrisch en vue de l’organisation d’une 
journée de sensibilisation et de formation en matière de violence domestique.  
 L’unité médico -légale de documentation des violences ( www.umedo.lu ) est un service du 
Laboratoire National de Santé (LNS). Elaboré conjointement avec des représentants des 
"Parquets, de la Police, du ministère de la Justice , du ministère de la Santé, du ministère de "
l’Égalité entre les femmes et les hommes et l’équipe du département de médecine légale du 
"LNS, ce service s’adresse aux victimes adultes de violences corporelles et/ou sexuelles, qui, "
"dans un premier temps, ne so uhaitent pas déposer plainte. En effet, seulement 5 à 10 % des "
victimes de violences décident d’entamer des démarches auprès du Parquet ou de la Police. 
UMEDO est composée par des médecins spécialistes en médecine légale du LNS. Dans le 
cadre d’une campagn e d’information lancée en mai 2021 surtout au niveau des réseaux 
"sociaux, l’UMEDO incite les victimes potentielles de se manifester pour faire documenter "
leurs blessures.  
 
4. Objectif stratégique : assurer une participation équilibrée des femmes et des homm es à la prise 
de décision politique et publique  
 
4.4 recherche et sensibilisation  
"Dans le contexte des prochaines élections communales en juin 2023, le ministère de l’Egalité entre "
les femmes et les hommes a lancé la campagne «  Vivre l’égalité  » pour motiver davantage de 
femmes de se présenter comme candidates aux élections communales. La campagne comporte trois 
"volets, à savoir  "
• une campagne sur les réseaux sociaux. S’adressant en priorité aux mandataires féminines 
"actuelles, cette campagne débute avec la réalisation de clips courts et de « visual statements » "
184 
 donnant l’occasion aux é lues de raconter leurs expériences individuelles vécues dans l’exercice de 
"leur mandat de bourgmestre, d’échevine ou de conseillère communale ;  "
• des portes ouvertes organisées par les communes intéressées ;  
• des formations spéciales tant pour les recru teuses et recruteurs dans les sections locales des 
"partis politiques ayant des listes électorales, que pour les candidates qui se sont présentées aux "
élections communales.  
Cette campagne durera jusqu’en mai 2023.   
 
6. Objectif stratégique : intégrer les questions d’égalité entre les femmes et les hommes dans 
toutes les politiques et mesures  
 
"6.5 Autres développements pertinents ,  "
"Le nouvel Observatoire de l’Egalité , présenté en 9 mars 2021, répond à trois fonctions principales :  "
 
• fournir des données objectives pour développer des stratégies politiques  
• soutenir le travail des professionnels du terrain en leur donnant une vue d’ensemble chiffrée  
• suivre et analyser les évolutions de la situation  
 
S’inspirant du «  Gender Equality Index  » (GEI) de l’Institut européen pour l’égalité entre les sexes 
"(EIGE), l’Observatoire se décline en sept domaines. Les indicateurs sont progressivement développés "
et finalisés jusqu’en 2023. L’Observatoire repose avant tou t sur le site web ( www.observatoire -
egalite.lu ) destiné au grand public.  
 
La violence domestique et l’emploi ont été les premiers domaines de l’Observatoire à être 
implémentés en 2020. L’égalité dans la p rise de décision a été analysée en 2021. Elle inclura le champ 
"politique, l’économie, le pouvoir judiciaire, l’administration, la société civile, le sport, la culture et les "
médias. L’Observatoire a également approfondi les données sur l’équilibre entre la  vie privée et la vie 
"professionnelle, domaine qui est complémentaire par rapport aux données sur l’emploi et qui sera "
particulièrement utile pour analyser les effets de la pandémie.

 Malta  
 
1. Strategic objective: Prevent and combat gender stereotypes and sexism  
 
1.2 Policy changes  
"One of the objectives of Malta’s first Gender Equality and Mainstreaming Strategy & Action Plan, "
"which is aimed to be introduced by end 2022, is to strengthen the principle of gender equality and "
"mainstreaming in various policy areas, including in the education system with the aim of challenging "
gender stereotypes. The aim is to prevent and combat gender stereotypes and sexism considering 
that gender stereotypes are a root cause of gender inequality and affect all areas of  society. Gender 
"stereotypes are often combined with other stereotypes such as those based on race or ethnic origin, "
"religion or belief, disability, age, or sexual orientation, hence this Strategy and Action Plan aims to "
adopt intersectionality throughout.  
 
The Directive (EU) 2019/1158 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on 
"Work -Life Balance for Parents and Carers, was transposed into Maltese law on 12 July 2022 through "
"Legal Notice 201 of 2022, titled the Work -Life Balance for Par ents and Carers Regulations.  "
 
"Legal Notice 201 of 2022 lays down the new minimum requirements in relation to paternity leave, "
"parental leave, and carers' leave, as well as flexible working arrangements for workers who are "
"parents, or carers. The aim is to facilitate the reconciliation of work and family life for parents and "
"carer, with the aim of achieving the goals of equality between men and women in labour market "
opportunities as well as equal treatment at work.  
 
"Continuously, the Department for Industri al and Employment Relations (DIER), actively seeks to "
eliminate discrimination and promote equality in the world of work. It promotes fair recruitment 
"and employment, equality in career and personal development opportunities and family friendly "
measures av ailable for all employees.  
 
1.4 Research and awareness raising  
The Human Rights Directorate (HRD) carried out several awareness raising campaigns across social 
media and in collaboration with local media houses highlighting key issues.  
 
"On International  Women’s Day, the HRD organised a business breakfast with all relevant "
stakeholders with the aim of discussing gender stereotypes in different sectors. It included three 
"panels: (1) Women’s Participation in the Labour Market, (2) Women & STEM and (3) Gende r-based "
"violence and domestic violence. Keynote speeches were also delivered by HRD, Malta’s Ambassador "
for Climate Action and the Minister responsible for Equality at the time. This was also 
complemented by a series of posts on social media aimed at raisi ng awareness on gender equality 
and eliminating stereotypes.  
 
"Throughout the year, the HRD commemorated several international days on social media. To this "
"end, HRD created infographics to commemorate the International Day of Families, the International "
"Day of Girls in ICT, Menstrual Hygiene Day and the International Day of Women and Girls in Science.  "
 
"Meanwhile, in January 2022, the National Commission for the Promotion of Equality (NCPE) "
published the 14th issue of the newsletter Equality Matters on ‘Equa lity in Sport’. This newsletter 
"delineated the benefits of sport participation, discrimination in sports based on gender, race and "
"ethnic origin, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sex characteristics, "
"recommendations on how to achieve equality in sports, and the NCPE’s role as the national equality "
"body. The newsletter was posted on the NCPE’s social media platforms, uploaded on the NCPE’s "
"website, and disseminated to different stakeholders.  "
 
186 
" In June 2022, the NCPE posted five a nimated social media posts on its Facebook and Instagram "
accounts to raise more awareness on discriminatory advertising.  
 
2. Strategic objective: Prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence  
 
2.1 Legislative changes  
"In February 2022, the Maltese Government presented a motion to Parliament for femicide to be "
recognised as an aggravating circumstance of homicide in the Maltese Criminal Code (Cap. 9 of the 
Laws of Malta). These amendments  are pending the final reading and endorsement from Parliament.  
 
No legislative changes regarding Trafficking in Human Beings were made during the reporting period. 
Article 248A ed sequit ur of the Maltese Criminal Code (Chapter 9 of the Laws of Malta) criminalises 
"Trafficking in Human beings. Upon conviction, any perpetrator may be liable to the punishment of "
imprisonment from six to twelve years.  
 
2.2 Policy changes  
The Maltese second national strategy on gender -based violence (GBV) and domestic violence (DV)  
is now in its final two quarters of implementation. Mon itoring and evaluation of its progress are 
ongoing. Quarterly progress reports from stakeholders are consolidated into annual reports. A third 
strategy is being drafted and is to be presented to cabinet in the first quarter of 2023. The strategy 
"builds on its precedents by adhering to provisions in the Istanbul Convention, GREVIO’s "
recommendations to Malta and overarching EU frameworks (including the EU’s GE Strategy).  
 
The Government of Malta also remains fully committed to combating Trafficking in Human Beings. 
"As stated in the EU Strategy on Combating Trafficking in Human Beings (2021 – 2025), most victims "
"within the EU are women and girls trafficked for sexual exploitation. Additionally, almost every "
fourth victim of trafficking in the EU is a child. Th e Human Rights Directorate is currently leading the 
government’s reform on anti -human trafficking and acting as a co -ordinating body for stakeholders 
"working in this field. As national co -ordinator, HRD is entrusted with the drafting of an Anti -"
"Trafficking  National Strategy. In this regard, several meetings were conducted with national "
"stakeholders including service providers. During these meetings various issues were raised including, "
"inter -alia, the importance of enhancing a human rights -based approach in  all actions and measures "
"concerning cases of THB, the principle of the best interest of the child, and the importance of "
"accurate and complete data -gathering on the subject matter. As regards the latter, HRD has "
furthered its collaboration with the Nation al Statistical Office (NSO) to develop a more efficient and 
accurate data -gathering mechanism.  
 
"In 2021, the Human Rights Directorate also successfully applied for EU assistance under the "
Technical Support Instrument (TSI) in the drafting of a national st rategy to combat THB. In this 
"regard, the Council of Europe has been engaged by the European Commission to provide its "
"expertise and assistance in the implementation of this project, which enshrines a human -rights "
based approach and aims to develop a susta inable system for the early identification of and 
comprehensive support for victims.  
 
"Furthermore, on 17 -19 January 2022, the Special Representative of the Organization for Security and "
Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) conducted an official visit to Malta. Th e purpose of the visit was to 
study Malta’s efforts in three main areas: (i) policy development and co -ordination of anti -trafficking 
efforts; (ii) financial investigations into trafficking in human beings; (iii) prevention of labour

 2.3 Institutional changes  
"The Commission on Gender -Based Violence and Domestic Violence (CGBVDV), Malta’s co -ordinating "
"body on GBV and DV, increased its human resources over the past year.  "
 
"Meanwhile, on 29 July 2022, as part of the Blue Heart Campaign, the Human Rights Directorate "
organised a networking event whereby Policy Development and Programme Implementation 
"Officers from all Ministries were invited to attend. During this event, the Permanent Secretary of the "
"Ministry for Home Affairs, Security, Reforms and Equality announced the setting up of the Anti -"
"Trafficking Inter -Ministerial Committee (IMC), which will ultimately enable the administration of the "
Government of Malta to ensure adherence with international obligations as well as those arising 
from EU Directives.  
 
2.4 Research and awareness raising  
"Through its MoU with the Faculty for Social Wellbeing  at the University of Malta, CGBVDV continued "
"its prevalence study  on children’s exposure to DV, and its pilot study  on introducing a safe dating "
programme in the national educational curricula. It also carried out quarterly themed awareness 
"raising campaigns, including: a campaign entitled Your Voice can Set You Free  (for 2021’s 16 Days of "
"Activism), a campaign and conference entitled Engaging Men and Boys in Violence Prevention , and "
a campaign entitled Consent Matters: Stop Sexual Violence . Upcoming campaigns include a 
campaign fo cused on intersectionality and migrants’ experiences of GBV and a campaign entitled 
Domestic Violence is Everybody’s Business! (for 2022’s 16 Days of Activism).  
 
The NCPE also participated in the 16 Days of Activism awareness -raising campaign by creating 
"motion graphics to empower victims of gender -based violence to speak up, sharing real -life stories "
"of domestic abuse survivors, and creating animated social media posts in both English and Maltese "
"on sexual harassment in the workplace. The latter were also published on the Intranet, an internet "
"service available to public officers. Additionally, the NCPE published an article in Maltese on a local "
newspaper to raise awareness on violence against women and girls.  
 
"Following the femicide of a Polish woman in Malta in January 2022, the NCPE organised and "
facilitated an online forum to raise awareness on violence against women and the link between 
"these forms of violence and gender inequalities, identifying possible way forward in this regard.  "
 
"In the coming day s, the NCPE will distribute a poster on sexual harassment at the workplace, which "
"is aimed at being an outreach tool which raises awareness on the topic. During the reporting period, "
the NCPE also published a Press Statement on the links of gender inequali ty in society and femicide; 
an article on the role of men in preventing violence against women and promoting equality; an 
article on the femicide bill; an article on data collection vis -à-vis femicide; and an article on elder 
abuse.  
 
"The Human Rights Direc torate, meanwhile, collaborated with the Commission for Domestic Violence "
and Gender Based Violence and the Migrant Women Association Malta to commemorate the 
International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation. This was done through the 
crea tion of several social media posts shared on all platforms as well as posters which were 
translated and distributed in various health centres across Malta and Gozo.  
 
The HRD also organised an online seminar on ‘Sexual Violence as a War Tactic’ to commemora te the 
International Day for the Elimination of Sexual Violence in Conflict which was open to individuals 
"from governmental departments, academia, and civil society in Malta. The speakers included Mr "
"John Busuttil, the Director of Global Issues at the Mini stry for European and Foreign Affairs and "
"Trade, Dr Bryony Balzia Bartolo who focused on the legal aspects of sexual violence, Ms Michelle "
Calleja Chehab (IOM) who spoke about IOM’s experiences with sexual violence and conflict and Ms 
Daryna Mizina (Amnest y International Ukraine) who spoke about sexual violence in Ukraine. The 
188 
" event was moderated by Dr Valentina Cassar, a senior lecturer at the University of Malta’s "
Department of International Relations.  
 
"For the third year running, Malta took part in the B lue Heart Campaign to raise awareness about "
"THB. During the week starting 25 July 2022, a series of awareness raising activities were organised "
by the Human Rights Directorate in collaboration with various government entities. These activities 
"include outr each sessions aimed at marginalised groups such as migrants, homeless persons and "
"persons working in the sex industry, which began on 26 July 2022 and remain ongoing. These "
sessions are based on the idea that spreading awareness is one of the best ways to stop this 
"phenomenon. While every person can end up being a victim of this heinous crime, it is evident that "
certain situations increase the risk of persons being trafficked.  
 
"Furthermore, during two family events held in the communities of Gżira and Buġibba, "
"representatives from the Victim Support Agency, the Malta Police Force, and the Foundation for "
Social Welfare Services informed the public about the various support services and protection 
measures available to victims of trafficking.  
 
Other infor mational sessions about the signs of human trafficking were also held for frontline 
"employees, such as the police, medical staff at various hospitals and health facilities, and social "
workers employed by organisations like AWAS and Corradino Correctional F acility. Awareness raising 
is also held through regular media slots and articles.  
 
2.5 Other pertinent developments  
"CGBVDV provided general multi -agency training sessions on GBV and DV, more specific multi -agency "
training on child -to-parent violence and training for obstetrics and the gynaecology department on 
sexual assault management (details for the last two can be found in CGBVDV’s latest annual report). 
"It also submitted two project proposals to EU’s CERV funding programme, which activities are in li ne "
with the EU’s and Council of Europe’s (GREVIO) priorities.  
 
"The Human Rights Directorate, meanwhile, organised two networking events in collaboration with "
the Parliamentary Secretariat for Reforms and Equality. The first Networking Session was aimed at 
"senior officials in the Public Service, Civil Society Organisations, and members of the Diplomatic "
"corps. The event took place on the 27 July 2022 under the theme of ‘Use and Abuse of Technology’, "
mirroring that of this year’s UN Blue Heart Campaign. The a im of this initiative was to increase 
transnational co -operation between Malta and the international institutions and third countries in 
"the fight against Trafficking in Human Beings. The second networking event was held on 29 July 2022, "
"during which the P ermanent Secretary of the Ministry for Home Affairs, Security, Reforms and "
Equality announced the setting -up of the Anti -Trafficking Inter -Ministerial Committee.  
 
3. Strategic objective: Ensure the equal access of women to justice  
 
3.1 Legislative changes   
The rules on the burden of proof and locus standii  have not changed and are equal to all irrespective 
of one’s gender.  
 
"In June 2022, Parliament approved the Femicide Bill, which adds the concept of femicide to Malta's "
legal structure. It limits the judiciary's discretion when it comes to sentencing in relation to 
homicides with femicidal circumstances - when a woman is killed because she is a woman. In such 
"cases, the defence of 'crime of passion' will no longer be deemed to be an acceptable mitigati ng "
factor.  
 
  
189 
  
3.2 Policy changes  
The digitalisation of justice is a clearly a strategic priority for government. On the basis of the Digital 
"Justice Strategy for the years 2022 to 2027, court data will automatically be disaggregated by "
sex/gender. This  will in and of itself assist in the follow up to court decisions.  
 
3.3 Institutional changes  
"Following an institutional reform in 2019, the Office of the State Advocate was set up and took the "
advisory functions that used to be performed by the Attorney General. The first appointee who took 
"up office as State Advocate was a female, who later in 2020 became the first female appointed as "
"Attorney General in Malta. Moreover, as at end of December 2021, the number of female "
magistrates amount to 18 w hereas 8 females are appointed to the bench as Judges from a total of 
47 members of the judiciary.  
 
"Continuation of the 24/7 service provided by Legal Aid Malta for victims of domestic violence, a "
service which was launched in April 2020.

4. Strategic objective: Achieve balanced participation of women and men in political and public 
decision -making  
 
4.1 Legislative changes  
Act No. XX of 202130 was a significant development in gender equality in political and public decision -
"making. It introduced, by virtue of Article 52A of the Maltese Constitution,31 a corrective mechanism "
whereby if the number of MPs identifying as the under -represented sex to tals to less than 40% of all 
"the elected Members of Parliament (MPs), there shall be an increase of twelve MPs of the under -"
"represented sex. This mechanism has a sunset clause of twenty years from its coming into force, "
unless revoked or re -enacted (requir ing a two -thirds majority).  
 
"The same Act amended the General Elections Act (Cap. 354 of the Laws of Malta),32 increasing the "
number of members forming the Electoral Commission from eight to ten and requiring no less than 
four members of every sex.  
 
"This me chanism was first put to the test during the 2022 general election, and more than doubled "
the percentage of female Members of Parliament; from 13% in 2020 to 28% in 2022.33 34

"5. Strategic objective: Protect the rights of migrant, refugee and asylum -seeking women and girls  "
 
5.2 Policy changes  
The Anti -Racism Strategy 2021 -2023 was launched in October 2021. While this Strategy does not 
"specifically focus on each gender, it nevertheless aims to improve the situation and experience of "
minority groups and to enhance the quality of relationships and interactions between all groups in 
"society. In pursuing these outcomes, it takes an intersectional approach, acknowledging the "
diversity within minority groups.  
 
5.4 Research and awareness raising  
"HRD collaborated with the Commission on Gender -Based Violence and Domestic Violence, as well "
"as NGOs Migrant Women Association Malta and Aditus, in developing and implementing a campaign "
to raise awareness about zero tolerance for female genital mutilation . This included the creation of 
posters which were shared online on the International Day for Zero Tolerance for FGM and 
distributed across several health clinics and centres which offer services to migrants. The posters 
"were translated into 5 different la nguages (French, Somali, Arabic, Tigrinya and Bangla).  "
 
"As part of the Equality for all in Malta project, the Directorate worked with its project partners ENAR, "
"ENORB and Aditus in developing and delivering training to 120 representatives of religious beli ef, "
"race, and ethnic minorities on Malta’s anti -discrimination laws and the functions of the Equality "
Body. These sessions were aimed at empowering minority communities in Malta to enjoy their full 
"rights and remedies laid down in the law, including those recently introduced.  "
 
The Human Rights Directorate held a webinar on ‘Sexual Violence as a War tactic’ on Monday 20 
"June 2022 which was open to individuals from governmental departments, academia and civil "
"society in Malta. Director Global Issues at the Mi nistry for Foreign and European Affairs and Trade, "
"Mr John Busuttil was invited as a speaker on Women, Peace and Security at this event. Other "
"speakers included Dr Bryony Balzia Bartolo who focused on the legal aspects of sexual violence, Ms "
Michelle Calle ja Chehab (IOM) who spoke about IOM’s experiences with sexual violence and conflict 
and Ms Daryna Mizina (Amnesty International Ukraine) who spoke about sexual violence in Ukraine. 
The event was moderated by Dr Valentina Cassar who is a senior lecturer at the Department of 
International Relations.  
 
5.5 Other pertinent developments  
"The Human Rights Directorate is implementing its agreement with the Directorate for Research, "
Lifelong Learning and Employability to provide foundation courses of basic Maltese  and English 
languages from January to June 2022 to migrants residing in Malta who require literacy assistance 
and training. Completion of these courses will make students eligible for admission to Stage 1 of the 
I Belong Programme.  
 
Both female and male migrants also participated in training provided through the EU -funded project 
"Equality for all in Malta, which gave them the tools and the knowledge to report cases of "
discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief and/or race and ethnic origin to the  National 
Commission for the Promotion of Equality.  
 
  
191 
  
6. Strategic objective: Achieve gender mainstreaming in all policies and measures  
 
6.4 Research and awareness raising  
"In June 2022, the NCPE, as part of its Annual Conference, continued to develop the understanding "
of intersectional discrimination by highlighting how two or more characteristics can interact with 
each other at the same time in such a way as to produce distinct and specific forms of discrimination. 
Experiences of intersectional discri mination were shared by persons who have lived or witnessed 
"such discrimination, and the importance of an intersectionality approach was highlighted to help us "
understand and respond effectively to the real -life experiences of people encountering 
discrimin ation to ensure that equality is truly a reality for everyone.  
 
"In fulfilment of the International Women’s Day Conference 2022, the NCPE chose Women and "
"Intersecting Identities as a topic for discussion, in view that women are particularly prone to "
"interse ctional discrimination based on race, ethnicity, religion/belief, disability, age, sexual "
"orientation, and gender identity. Discussion was held with different stakeholders to raise awareness "
on this topic.  
 
6.5 Other pertinent developments  
"The NCPE continued working on gender mainstreaming as per Government policy, which seeks to "
ensure that policies and practices are gender mainstreamed. Training is given throughout the year 
to enhance the implementation of gender mainstreaming in both the public an d private entities. 
Each department and entity is reminded to prepare an annual report on the measures taken and the 
progress achieved in the sphere of gender equality and mainstreaming. This annual report is then 
forwarded to the NCPE with a synopsis also  to be included in the department’s annual report. As of 
"June 2022, the NCPE had received 149 reports that were included in an analytical analysis forwarded "
to the Permanent Secretary within the Ministry responsible for Equality.  
 
7. Main challenges and less ons learned  
Main challenges identified:  
"• Culture change and change in attitudes remains one of the challenges. Changing beliefs, attitudes "
and practices does not take place overnight but is a developmental process with requires time.  
• The need to gain a better understanding of gender mainstreaming and its implementation in 
various sector  
• Limited gender disaggregated data and research  
• Co -ordinating and coming to an agreement with different stakeholders with regards to having a 
national strategy  
"• Inadequate human, technical and financial investments.  "
 
Lessons learned:  
• Needs analysis for better provision of training adapting to different target groups  
• Education and raising awareness  
• Sharing of best practices with different stakeholders.  
 
8. Additional comments  
Malta is currently in the process of finalising its first Gender Equality and Mainstreaming Strategy & 
Action Plan covering the period from 2022 -2027. This followed extensive research and consultation 
with all  stakeholders. This document will mark an important milestone in Malta’s efforts to achieve 
"full gender equality in all spheres of life, since, for the first time, it proposes a cohesive, "
"mainstreamed approach to the hurdles faced by individuals in Malta, particularly women, due to "
their gender.

Protection Order and registered  by the Ministry of Justice on 24 December 2021 has been enforced 
on 1 January 2022 and will be used in parallel with CORM 006 -14 until 30 June 2022 in order to 
ensure smooth transition. The Classificatory developed with expert support from UN Women with 
"Sweden funds has over 80% out of 5,600 occupations/positions with feminine equivalents attested "
in lexicographic sources.  
 
"b) Regarding the criminalisation of hate speech based on gender criteria, it should be noted "

"amendment of some normative acts, by which the Criminal Code and the Code of Criminal "
"Procedure, the Code of Criminal Procedure were amended. According to the provisions of art. 346 "
"of the Criminal Cod e, in the revised wording, establishes the obligation to punish actions of "
"incitement to hatred or violence, manifested through public exhortations, dissemination of "
"information or other forms of public information, including through mass media, in written  form, "
"drawing or image, or through a computer system, against a category of people based on prejudice, "
"which also includes the criterion of sex. Additionally, the Criminal Code in the general part was "
"supplemented with a new article (134/21) that defines ""reasons for prejudice"", and in several "
"components of the crimes the commission of the act ""for reasons of prejudice"" was introduced as "
an aggravating factor. The contravention code was supplemented with art. 701 which sanctions

"made to the notions of discrimination contained in Law No. 121/2012 on ensuring equality, (namely "
"on the notions of ""discrimination"", ""direct discrimination"", ""indirect discrimination"", harassment"", "
"""incitement to discriminati on"", etc.), as well as providing more powers and competences to the "
Council for preventing and eliminating discrimination and ensuring equality. All of these non -
discrimination notions cover the public and private spheres and protect all persons.  
 
d) In the E ducation Code of the Republic of Moldova No. 152/2014 one of the fundamental 
principles of education is the principle of equity - based on which access to learning is achieved

"partner, is GirlGo IT https://girl sgoit.org/ro/  "
 
"b) In April 2022, the new Regulation on the evaluation and purchase of school textbooks was "
approved. One of the evaluation criteria included is “Non -discriminatory character” which is 
"based on four descriptors that are evaluated. Thus, in the context of the curriculum reform, new "
"schoolbooks planned to be procured will be evaluated under the new Regulation, including any "
forms of discrimination.  
 
"c) In order to combat gender stereotypes, discrimination and promote positive social norms that "
"preve nt gender -based violence, eight pilot clubs to support men in the equal sharing of "
household and family responsibilities were created in two districts of the country (through the 
195 
" regional programme “Together against gender stereotypes and gender -based viol ence”, funded "
by the European Union and implemented by UN Women and UNFPA).  
 
2. Strategic objective: Prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence  
 
2.1 Legislative changes  
1. The intersectoral protocol for the co -ordinated response to violence against women in accordance 
with the Istanbul Convention was approved by the relevant ministries (Ministry of Labour and Social 
"Protection, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of He alth, Ministry of Justice). The order of approval "
"has been signed on 21 June 2022, within a broadcast event  organised by Ministry of Labour and "
"Social Protection, with the support of UN Women. A follow -up online communication action  on the "
interventions and commitments of line Min istries has been conducted on social media.  
 
2. The 2nd package of laws on the amendment of Moldovan legislation in accordance with the 
"Istanbul Convention, developed by the Ministry of Justice in partnership with civil society, was "
approved by the Governm ent and was sent to the Parliament for endorsement. The draft law 
"amends key provisions relating to domestic violence in the Criminal Code, Criminal Procedure Code, "
"Civil Procedure Code, Misdemeanour Code, etc. Through the provisions of this draft law, it was "
"proposed to redefine the notion of rape, to guarantee a mechanism for ensuring the procedural "
"rights of victims of crimes related to sexual freedom and integrity, as well as to develop a functional "
mechanism regarding the application of protective meas ures in the case of domestic violence and 
"requesting the protective order. Additionally, it was proposed to increase the criminal liability for "
acts of domestic violence knowingly committed against a minor or against a pregnant woman or 
"taking advantage of  the victim's powerlessness, which is due to old age, illness, disability or another "
"factor. In order to ensure effective legal protection, the draft law also provides for the fulfilment of "
"the victim's rights with the right to give explanations in friendl y conditions, in the absence of the "
"suspected person; to be assisted, under the law, by a lawyer who provides legal assistance "
"guaranteed by the state; to have ensured his right to privacy, to the protection of his personal image, "
"to medical, medico -legal,  post -traumatic psychological assistance and counselling services, with a "
"view to physical and psychosocial recovery. Finally, the project contains proposals for modifying the "
procedural rules in order to limit contact between the alleged aggressor and the  victim of violence. 
This amendment aims to reduce the re -victimisation of the victim in the event of his confrontation 
with the person suspected or accused of committing the crime.  
 
"3. On 26 May 2022, the Parliament approved in the first reading the draft  law on the amendment of "
"some normative acts, through which changes were made to the Labour Code, the Contravention "
"Code, the Law of the State Labour Inspectorate and the Law of Trade Unions. The Act proposes to "
supplement the Criminal Code with provisions  regarding holding employers accountable for failure 
"to comply with the obligation to undertake prevention, examination and intervention measures in "
"the event of detection of acts of sexual harassment at the workplace. Likewise, employers who "
obstruct the process of reporting cases of sexual harassment at work may be penalised. Another 
provision of the project refers to the competence of the State Labour Inspectorate and the 
"Confederation of Trade Unions in the field of prevention, examination and solving t he cases of sexual "

UNCHR and other UN Agencies supported the Government and the Congress of Local Authorities 
from Moldova (CALM) in operationalizing the Refugee Crisis Response Cell managed on the national 
and local levels. It is one stop shop for Government and CALM to col lect the needs of local public 
"authorities in addressing the refugee crisis, match the identified gaps with available support from "
"donors and government, and provide referrals to refugee related services provided by Government "
and/or humanitarian/developme nt agencies.  
 
"At the same time, under the auspices of UNHCR, several working groups have been set up in "
"partnership with UN agencies, civil society, and central public authorities on all dimensions of "
assistance to ensure synchronous and complementary co -ordination throughout the refugee 
migration route. Here we also note the importance of setting up groups in the areas of preventing

1. Objectif stratégique: prévenir et combattre les stéréotypes de genres et le sexisme  
 
1.1 changements législatifs   
S’agissant des changements juridiques ayant pour objectif de prévenir et combattre les stéréotypes 
"de genre et le sexisme, survenus entre novembre 2021 et décembre 2022, on signalera  :  "
 
- la loi n° 1.523 du 16 mai 2022 relative à la promotion et la protec tion des droits des femmes par 
l’abrogation des dispositions obsolètes et inégalitaires.  
 
La loi a été publiée au journal de Monaco le 27 mai 2022 :  
 
https://journ aldemonaco.gouv.mc/Journaux/2022/Journal -8592/Loi -n-1.523 -du-16-mai-2022 -
relative -a-la-promotion -et-la-protection -des-droits -des-femmes -par-la-modification -et-l-
abrogation -des-dispositions -obsoletes -et-inegalitaires  
 
En vue de procéder à la modification et  l’abrogation des dispositions obsolètes ou inégalitaires à 
"l’égard des femmes, recensées dans l’ensemble des Codes et dispositions non codifiées du droit "
"monégasque, ce texte opère, d’une part, une actualisation de diverses références normatives, "
"résultan t des évolutions successives du droit, à l’instar de la suppression de dispositions relatives à "
"l’ancien régime dotal et, d’autre part, une adaptation des référentiels sémantiques, conduisant "
"notamment à neutraliser ou bilatéraliser certains énoncés sexués , fondés sur des conceptions "
aujourd’hui dépassées en raison des évolutions sociétales.   
 
Les exemples de modification  : suppression de la référence obsolète au statut juridique de la femme 
mariée dans les textes sur le droit syndical (Ordonnance -loi n° 3 99 du 6 octobre 1944 autorisation 
la création de syndicats professionnels et loi n° 403 du 28 janvier 1944 autorisant la création de 
syndicats patronaux)  ;  suppression d’une règle spécifique aux femmes concernant le travail les 
jours fériés légaux (loi n°  800 du 18 février 1966 régissant la rémunération et les conditions de travail 
relatives aux jours fériés légaux)  ; suppression des termes suggérant que l'exercice de certains 
métiers comme huissier ou notaire ne pouvait être réservé qu'à un homme ont été abroges  ; 
suppression du délai de viduité qui imposait aux femmes d'attendre 310 jours pour se remarier soit 
à la suite d'un veuvage soit d'une dissolution du mariage  ; suppression des expressions de «  bon 
père de famille  » pour des termes plus neutres et non genrés. Cette modernisation des textes 
juridiques contribue ainsi à mettre la Principauté en adéquation avec l'évolution de la société.  
 
- La loi n° 1.513 du 3 décembre 2021 relative à la lutte contre le harcèlement et la violence en 
milieu scolaire  (ancien projet de loi n° 1.036) qui a doté le droit monégasque de dispositifs adaptés 
"destinés à identifier, prévenir, signaler, traiter et réprimer les situations de harcèlement et de "
"violence en milieu scolaire. Elle affirme le droit pour chaque élève, sans différenciation de sexe, "
d’apprendre et grandir dans un cadre scolaire protecteur et sécurisé.  
 
Les dispositions de ce texte de référence permettent à chaque établissement d’enseignement de la 
"Principauté de se doter d’outils et de méthodes, de préve ntion et d’action, pour endiguer le "
"harcèlement en milieu scolaire dans ses acceptions larges (établissement scolaire et abords, réseaux "
sociaux). Un plan de prévention décliné en action de sensibilisation auprès des élèves et de 
"formation auprès des perso nnels des établissements scolaires a été mis en œuvre, dans une "
approche qui intègre toutes les formes de violence et de discrimination au cœur de ses actions. Par 
"cette initiative, saluée par la Commission Européenne contre le racisme et l’Intolérance (EC RI), mise "
204 
" en place par le Conseil de l’Europe, la Principauté affirme la place majeure de l’Ecole dans la lutte "
contre les stéréotypes et le sexisme.  
 
"Par ailleurs, il est à noter que les Règlements Intérieurs des établissements scolaires de la "
Principaut é comportent désormais une mesure aggravante au prononcé des punitions et sanctions 
disciplinaires si les manquements commis envers une personne ou un autre de personne ont été 
"commis en raison du sexe, du handicap, de l’origine, de l’orientation sexuelle,  de l’appartenance ou "
"de la non -appartenance, réelle ou supposée, à une ethnie, une nation ou une race déterminée ou "
"encore à l’adhésion ou la non adhésion, vraie ou supposée, à une religion.  "
 
- La jurisprudence du Tribunal du travail en matière de harcèle ment au travail  qui fait apparaître 
"une fermeté particulière à l’égard des actes de harcèlement à caractère sexiste, y compris pour des "
faits antérieurs à l’adoption de la loi n° 1.457 du 12 décembre 2017 relative au harcèlement et à la 
"violence au travail , le Tribunal se fondant alors sur l’obligation générale, pour l’employeur, d’assurer "
"la santé et la sécurité de ses salariés (v. par exemple, T.T., 9 nov. 2021).  "
 
"Enfin, pour les fonctionnaires l'allongement du congé paternité de 12 à 21 jours sera effect if à partir "
du 1er janvier 2023 suite au vote de la loi modifiant la loi n° 975 portant statut des fonctionnaires 
de l'Etat. Cette mesure permet de tendre vers un partage plus égal des responsabilités au sein du 
couple. C'est aussi un moyen de continuer à lutter contre les stéréotypes qui font reposer la charge 
"des enfants sur la mère en facilitant l'implication du père dans la sphère familiale, et ce, dès la "
naissance.  
 
1.2 changements dans les politiques publiques   
Au titre des changements dans les politiques publiques en matière de lutte contre le sexisme et les 
"stéréotypes de genre, entre novembre 2021 et décembre 2022, on relèvera  : "
 
- l’aboutissement de la recherche sur les éventuelles inégalités de salaires entre hommes et 
"femmes , menée dans le cadre d’un groupe de travail du Comité pour la promotion et la protection "
"des droits des femmes, auquel participait la Direction du Travail sous l’autorité du Département des "
"Affaires Sociales et de la Santé. Cette recherche a été finalisée et a fait l’obj et d’une publication, "
ainsi que cela sera exposé au titre des actions de recherche et de sensibilisation.  
 
"Dans le même ordre d’idées, le Département des Affaires Sociales et de la Santé devrait réunir "
prochainement les représentants des employeurs de la Principauté pour faire un bilan d’étape sur 
"l’influence de la Charte pour l’égalité des femmes et des hommes  au travail,  signée le 7 novembre "
2019.  
 
1.3 changements institutionnels  
La thématique de l'éducation à l’égalité et de la lutte contre le sexisme s'inscrit dans le cadre des 
travaux du groupe «  Prévention et éducation  » instauré au sein du Comité pour la promotion et la 
protection des droits des femmes.  
 
"Dans ce cadre, la Dir ection de l’Éducation Nationale, de la Jeunesse et des Sports a poursuivi son "
"action en faveur de l’égalité Fille / Garçon – Femme / Homme, en prenant une part active au sein "
du Comité pour la protection et la promotion des droits des femmes avec la désign ation d’un 
"référent «  Egalité. La lutte contre les stéréotypes et la garantie de l’égalité de chacun, "
"indépendamment de son sexe, de son origine, de ses spécificités, font depuis toujours l’objet "
d’actions éducatives et pédagogiques déclinées dans le respe ct des engagements internationaux de 
la Principauté pour l’élimination de toutes formes de discrimination (Stratégie 2018 -2023 du Conseil 
"de l’Europe et Convention de l’Organisation des Nations Unies sur cette thématique, notamment).  "
 
205 
" Au titre de membre de  ce Comité, cette Direction a été à l’initiative d’actions concrètes à l’attention "
"des élèves de la Principauté mais également à l’égard des personnels enseignants, de direction, "
"d’éducation, d’orientation, administratifs, techniques, sociaux et de santé, qui doivent continuer à "
"être les relais d’une politique active dans la lutte contre tout type de discrimination, de sexisme ou "
de violence.  
 
1.4 recherche et sensibilisation  
Au titre des actions de recherche et de sensibilisation à la lutte contre le sexisme et les stéréotypes 
"de genre, entre novembre 2021 et décembre 2022, on notera  :  "
 
"- la parution, en juillet 2022, de l’enquête réalisée par l’Institut Monégasque de la Stat istique et "
"des Etudes Economiques (IMSEE) sur l’égalité des salaires entre hommes et femmes à Monaco , "
dans le secteur privé comme dans le secteur public.  
 
"Cette étude révèle que la situation est, en ce qui concerne le secteur public, équilibrée. Les emplo is "
de cadres supérieurs se féminisent depuis plusieurs années et les femmes occupent désormais 47% 
de ces postes stratégiques. L'écart du point d'indice de rémunération moyen entre hommes et 
"femmes est à la faveur des femmes, à hauteur de 0,7% en 2019. Cel a s'explique par une plus grande "
proportion de femmes occupant des postes de cadres (Catégorie A).  
 
"Dans le secteur privé, les chiffres sont plus contrastés. En se basant sur la différence entre le salaire "
"médian des hommes et des femmes tel que défini pa r l’OCDE, Monaco affiche un écart de 5,9 % en "
faveur des hommes. Cela signifie que la Principauté figurerait parmi les 10 pays les plus égalitaires 
du classement de l’OCDE.  
 
- La campagne de sensibilisation intitulée «  Tout le monde a sa place dans la gouv ernance 
d’entreprise  » menée au mois de septembre 2022  par le Comité pour la promotion et la protection 
"des droits des femmes. Cette campagne, avec le «  #egaliteJagis  », encourage la participation active "
des femmes aux postes clés et à la prise de décision  stratégique dans le milieu professionnel.  
"- La Journée Internationale des Droits de l’Enfant. Une attention particulière  a été portée, entre "
"novembre 2021 et décembre 2022, sur la nécessité de permettre à chaque enfant, et plus "
"particulièrement aux jeune s filles de pays africains, d’accéder à une éducation porteuse de valeurs, "
"de repères, et garante de liberté et d’autonomie. Le documentaire de Pascal PLISSON, réalisateur, "
"scénariste et documentariste français, intitulé «  Gogo  », réalisé avec le soutien d e l’UNICEF, a "
rythmé la campagne 2021 des Droits de l’Enfant en prenant exemple sur le parcours de vie hors 
norme d’une sage -femme qui est retournée sur les bancs de l’école à plus de 80 ans pour inciter les 
petites et jeunes filles kenyanes à devenir actr ices de leur avenir.  
"- Le partenariat de la Direction de l’Education Nationale, de la Jeunesse et des Sports avec  "
l’association «  Au cœurs des mots  » placée sous la Présidence d’honneur de S.A.S. le Prince Albert 
"II de Monaco, avec le soutien de l’Organisa tion Internationale de la Francophonie. Des élèves de "
l’enseignement secondaire de la Principauté ont ainsi été invités à concourir au niveau mondial pour 
"l’égalité des filles et des garçons et par la promotion de la langue française, par des créations "
"littéraires, poétiques ou théâtrales.  "
- Le débat d’idées  sur les questions relatives aux discriminations et maltraitances en raison du 
sexe . Les élèves des classes de 3ème ont participé à une expérience inédite en novembre au cours de 
laquelle il leur a été possible de participer à une pièce de théâtre interactive (théâtre -forum) en lien 
avec des associations locales engagées dans la protection des droits des femmes.  
- L’égalité dans le monde du travail.  Une campagne de promotion de l’égalité femmes -hommes a 
été menée en 2021 par le biais de photographies mettant à l’honneur 80 femmes et hommes de la 
"Principauté, associés par binôme, qui exercent la même activité pour montre r que tous les métiers "
sont accessibles. Cette opération a été menée dans le prolongement de la charte « Monégalité  » 
lancée par le Gouvernement Princier pour promouvoir l’égalité femmes / hommes au travail. Deux 
professeurs des écoles (une femme et un hom me) y ont participé.  
 
206 
" Dans le domaine de la prévention , il est à noter qu’une action politique de santé publique a été "
mise en œuvre par l’Institut de Formation aux Soins Infirmiers  en faveur des élèves de 4ème de 
"l’enseignement public et privé de la Principauté sur les thématiques du respect de soi et de l’autre, "
des relations amoureuses et des infections sexuellement transmissibles (IST).  
 
1.5 autres développements pertinents  
Le Comité pour la promotion et la protection des droits des femmes a diffusé des vidéos sur les 
réseaux sociaux où femmes et hommes de Monaco ont été interviewés à l'occasion de Journées 
"Internationales en lien avec la thématique «  femme  ». Par ailleurs, le Comité a créé une rubrique "
dédiée à la «  Santé des femmes  » sur son site internet permettant d'aborder des problématiques 
"touchant les femmes : ostéoporose, précarité menstruelle, cancer du sein.  "
 
2. Objectif stratégique: prévenir et combattre la violence contre les femmes et la violence 
domestique  
 
2.1 changements législatifs  
"S’agissant des lois en matière de lutte contre les violences faites aux femmes, on signalera :  "
 
- la loi n°1.517 du 23 décembre 2021 portant réforme des dispositions relatives à l’incrimination des 
agressions sexuelles  qui prévoit une meilleure définition des comportements réprimés et une 
"meilleure protection des victimes pour libérer la parole, renforce la lutte contre le s agressions "
sexuelles en complétant et en élargissant les infractions prévues par le code pénal monégasque.  
 
Ses apports fondamentaux :  
 
- redéfinition de certaines incriminations spécifiques à la lutte contre les violences sexuelles mais sans 
"en diminue r les peines encourues (instauration de l'infraction d'exhibition sexuelle, insertion dans le "
"Code pénal de l'infraction de harcèlement moral au travail, incrimination spécifique du harcèlement "
"sexuel, incrimination spécifique du chantage sexuel, incrimina tion spécifique de l'infraction d'atteinte "
sexuelle)  ;  
 
"- renforcement des circonstances aggravantes, ce qui a conduit notamment à reconnaître le viol et "
l'agression sexuelle incestueuse comme circonstances aggravantes  ; 
 
"- ajustement des dispositions du Code de procédure pénale, conduisant, notamment à porter le délai "
de prescription pour les délits d'atteinte sexuelle et d'agression sexuelle à 20 années à compter du 
jour de la majorité de la victime mineure  ; 
 
- positionnement de la notion d'absence de c onsentement au cœur de la définition des infractions de 
"violence sexuelle, comme recommandé par les instances européennes, conduisant notamment à "
l'intégration d'une présomption irréfragable d'absence de consentement lorsque le viol ou l'agression 
sexuelle  est commise sur un mineur de moins de 13 ans ou lorsque ces infractions ont un caractère 
incestueux sur un mineur quel que soit son âge.   
 
- La loi n° 1513 du 3 décembre 2021 relative à la lutte contre le harcèlement et la violence en milieu 
"scolaire  Cette loi est venue compléter l’arsenal des mesures pénales en intégrant des infractions qui, "
"sans être exclusivement dédiées à la lutte contre les violences faites aux femmes, tendent néanmoins "
à embrasser cet objectif. Tel est plus précisément le cas du  délit destiné à répondre au phénomène 
"de « vengeance pornographique » souvent perpétré à l’encontre des femmes, et consistant à mettre "
"en ligne les photographies, ou tout contenu audiovisuel, d’une personne dans son intimité sexuelle, "
sans qu’elle ait con senti à cette diffusion.  
  
207 
 2.2 changements dans les politiques publiques  
"S’agissant  des changements  dans  les politiques  publiques  concernant  la violence  domestique,  entre  "
"novembre  2021  et décembre  2022,  on évoquera  :  "
 
"- l’élaboration,  au cours  de l’année  2022,  d’un  guide  de l’information  préoccupante  et du "
signalement  en matière  de protection  de l’enfance  à destination  des entités  publiques  et associatives  
œuvrant  auprès  des mineurs.  Même  si ce guide  ne vise pas directement  la violence  à l’égard  des 
"femmes,  il s’applique  aux violences  intrafamiliales  et concerne  notamment  les mères  d’enfants  en "
situation  de danger.   
 
2.3 changements institutionnels  
"Au titre des changements institutionnels en matière de lutte contre les violences faites aux femmes, "
"entre novembre 2021 et décembre 2022, on notera  :  "
 
- Le déploiement d’un plan de formation  par le groupe thématique dédié à la formation 
professionnelle du Comité pour la protection et la promotion des droits des femmes : environ 300 
"personnes des services administratifs et hospitaliers (personnels des services sociaux, de la police, des "
établi ssements scolaires) ont été formés à l'accueil des victimes de violences. Un module de formation 
dédié à la prise en charge des victimes de violences a été déployé en 2022 auprès des travailleurs 
sociaux et des policiers notamment.  
 
- Les actions de format ion mises en place suite à l’adoption de la loi n° 1513 du 3 décembre 2021 
"relative à la lutte contre le harcèlement et la violence  en milieu scolaire , soit  : "
 
 des ateliers de « mieux vivre ensemble » (méthodes de communication non -violente et de 
gestion des conflits) sont mis en place à destination des élèves des établissements 
d’enseignement publics ou privés de la Principauté ;  
  
 une formation des adultes à la médiation scolaire dispensée au personnel enseignant et non 
enseignant des établissements scol aires dans la perspective de l’amélioration du climat scolaire 
et de la prévention du harcèlement  ;  
 
 des formations en matière de harcèlement dispensées aux «  référents harcèlement  » des 
établissements scolaires préalablement à leur désignation (recueil de la parole des mineurs 
"victimes, traitement des situations de harcèlement ou de violence en milieu scolaire et "
médiation. Des intervenants référents en matière de lutte contre les violences faites aux 
"femmes, ont pu présenter des techniques et des outils  destinés à mieux comprendre les "
"différentes formes de violence, leurs cycles et leurs mécanismes.  "
 
2.4 recherche et sensibilisation  
"Au titre des actions de recherche et de sensibilisation en matière de violences faites aux femmes, "
"entre novembre 2021 et décembre 2022, on signalera  : "
 
- la collecte des données depuis 2019 par l’IMSEE  permettant d'établir une étude annuelle sur les 
violences faites aux femmes à Monaco.  
Cette étude présente les principales données disponibles sur cette thématique et dres se un état des 
lieux des violences selon différents indicateurs mesurables. Les informations sont récoltées et 
"analysées par l'IMSEE auprès des différentes sources. Outre le nombre de cas, l'IMSEE s'attache "
"également, lorsque cela est possible, à étendre c et état des lieux a des données complémentaires "
"telles que l'analyse des types de violences commises, le ou les lieu(x) des violences, l’âge des victimes "
"ou encore à leur lien avec l'auteur, ce qui permettra, à plus long terme d'être en mesure de disposer "
"d'une série complète sur plusieurs années, pour analyser l'éventuelle évolution de ce phénomène, et "
mettre en place des actions ciblées.  
208 
 - La participation du Gouvernement Princier à la Journée internationale pour l’élimination de la 
"violence à l’égard des  femmes du 25 novembre , en collaboration notamment avec les partenaires "
institutionnels et associatifs amenés à prendre en charge les femmes victimes de violences sur le 
"territoire monégasque, dans le but de sensibiliser le grand public à cette cause.  "
 
La campagne 2022 a mis l'accent sur la place des hommes dans la lutte contre les violences mais aussi 
plus généralement sur les différents moyens d'agir auprès des victimes et des agresseurs. Cette 
campagne s'articulait autour de plusieurs temps forts  :  
 
 la réalisation de trois mini -films interactifs de fiction. L'interactivité permettait au spectateur 
de prendre des décisions aux moments clés et donc d'influer sur le déroulement de l'histoire. Le 
slogan « Vous avez le pouvoir de changer l'histoire  » était au  cœur de la campagne qui accompagnait 
la diffusion de ces films  ; 
" l’installation de stands de sensibilisation en ville, les 23 novembre et 24 novembre. Cette "
action visait à rencontrer le public afin de mieux faire connaître les dispositifs en vigueur et les 
intervenants en Principauté  ; 
" la distribution de rubans blancs par le Comité, symboles de la lutte contre les violences faites "
aux femmes.  
 
"- La poursuite des opérations de diffusion, en 2022, d’une brochure (en anglais et en français) "
"élaborée l’année  précédente par la Direction de l'Action et de I’Aide Sociales, intitulée « Agir contre "
"les violences domestiques », destinée à informer et orienter les témoins et victimes de violences, "
notamment sur les aides qui pourraient leur être apportées mais égalem ent sur le parcours judiciaire 
qui serait le leur si ces personnes s'engageaient dans cette voie. Lesdites brochures ont été mises à 
disposition du public au sein du Palais de Justice.  
 
3. Objectif stratégique : garantir aux femmes l’égalité d’accès à la  justice  
 
3.1 changements législatifs  
Au titre des changements législatifs intervenus entre novembre 2021 et décembre 2022 ayant eu 
"pour effet de garantir l’accès des femmes à la justice, on mentionnera  :  "
 
- l’importante réforme de la procédure civile  (loi n° 1511 du 2 décembre 2021 portant modification 
de la procédure civile) qui a notamment introduit l’assistance judiciaire partielle. Ce dispositif 
assouplit les conditions d’attribution de l’aide financière apportée par l’Etat aux justiciables ayant 
"de faibles revenus, qui pourra donc profiter aux femmes ayant de moindres moyens financiers.  "
 
4. Objectif stratégique : assurer une participation équilibrée des femmes et des hommes à la prise 
de décision politique et publique  
 
4.4 recherche et sensibilisation  
Dans le cadre de la mise en œuvre de politiques publiques visant à promouvoir l’égalité entre les 
"femmes et les hommes, le Comité pour la promotion et la protection des droits des femmes a lancé "
une initiative visant à so utenir l'ambition des femmes pour contribuer à la création d'un monde 
professionnel plus égalitaire. Le programme de développement professionnel féminin proposé en 
2021 à des femmes du secteur public et privé en Principauté s'est poursuivi en 2022.  
 
Ce pro gramme invite les participantes à adopter de nouveaux comportements afin qu'elles affichent 
davantage leurs ambitions et qu'elles maximisent leurs talents pour en faire bénéficier leur 
organisation. Ce programme est appelé à se développer afin de créer un véritable réseau de femmes 
"afin de les rendre plus visibles et, à terme, de leur permettre d'accéder aux sphères décisionnelles.  "

Au niveau des changements dans les politiques publiques visant à protéger les droits des femmes 
"migrantes, réfugiées et demandeuses d’asile, entre novembre 2021 et décembre 2022, on "
signalera  : 
 
- la circulaire en cours d’élaboration pour répondre aux recommandations du Groupe d’experts 
sur la lutte contre la traite des êtres humains du Conseil de l’Europe (GRE TA). Cette circulaire est 
destinée à coordonner l’action – déjà existante – des différents services intervenant ou pouvant 
intervenir en matière d’identification et de prise en charge des victimes de traite des êtres humains. 
"Aussi, il convient de noter qu e dans le cadre d’une éventuelle prise en charge de victime de traite "
"des êtres humains, il est prévu que la Direction de l’Action et de l’Aide Sociales attribue des aides "
"financières, une assistance psychologique, un accès aux soins par le biais d’une cou verture médicale, "
ainsi qu’une mise à l’abri qui leur seraient nécessaires au regard de leur situation.  
 
- La mise en place d’un dispositif spécifique d’accompagnement en faveur des Ukrainiens fuyant 
"la guerre dans leur pays . Ces ressortissants ukrainiens sont, pour la majeure partie, des femmes "
accompagnées de leurs enfants.   
 
"Ce dispositif permet à ces personnes dans le besoin, de bénéficier d’une autorisation provisoire de "
"séjour, d’une allocation financière mensuelle, d’une couverture médicale gratuite,  d’une aide "
"alimentaire et produits d’hygiène, d’une mise à disposition de logements et de la scolarisation des "
enfants. Les Ukrainiens déplacés peuvent également bénéficier d’une prise en charge psychologique 
par le Centre Hospitalier Princesse Grace de M onaco (seul hôpital de Monaco) ou encore d’une 
"cellule d’écoute, de soutien et d’orientation mise en place par la Croix Rouge Monégasque. Il leur "
est également proposé une aide à l’insertion professionnelle auprès du Service de l’Emploi et des 
"cours de fra nçais. Il convient de noter que la Croix Rouge Monégasque distribue des aides d’urgence, "
"à savoir des tickets alimentaires et des espèces, ainsi qu’un forfait alloué à l’achat de lait et de "
couches pour les bébés. Les personnes âgées ou handicapées peuvent  bénéficier d’un plan d’aide

Au titre de la politique menée par le Gouvernement Princier dans le domaine de l’éducation plus 
"particulièrement , peuvent être notés les points suivants :  "
 
- l’orientation scolaire et professionnelle sans stéréotype. Le Centre de Formation Pédagogique du 
"2nd degré de la Direction de l’Education Nationale, de la Jeunesse et des Sports de Monaco a "
accompagné les équipes éducatives dans la mise en œuvre de dispositions favorisant l’égalité de 
"genre, dans les pratiques pédagogiques mais également dans l’accompa gnement des élèves vers "
une orientation scolaire et professionnelle sans stéréotype. Trois journées de formation  ont ainsi 
"été proposées à une quarantaine d’enseignants, essentiellement des professeurs principaux. Elles "
ont été assurées par un référent -formateur dédié à l’égalité fille -garçon désigné au sein de cette 
Direction pour garantir la mise en œuvre optimale des actions menées et à venir dans le domaine 
"de la promotion de l’égalité fille -garçon. Parallèlement, un concours scolaire de productions "
"num ériques a été initié par la Direction de l’Education Nationale, de la Jeunesse et des Sports, au "
"titre de la rentrée scolaire 2022, autour de la déconstruction et de la dénonciation des stéréotypes "

 The Netherlands  
 
1. Strategic objective: Prevent and combat gender stereotypes and sexism  
 
1.2 Policy changes  
- As of 1 January 2022 a new act entered into force to increase a more balanced male/female -
ratio in top positions in the private sector. Listed companies will now have to comply to a 
statutory diversity quota of at least one third of women and men in their supervisory boards. 
A new appointment that does not attribute to a more balanced male/female ratio will be null 
and void.  
 
"- Additionally, an obligation for large companies is introduced to set 'ambitious' targets to reach "
"a more balanced male/female ratio in the board of directors, supervisory board and senior "
management. Large companies are obliged to draw up a plan for achieving these targets. On 
"an annual basis, these companies have to report on the state of play and the progress made, "
on a comply and ex plain basis.  
 
- The government has decided that measures in the private sector will be supplemented by 
measures in the public and semi -public sectors. Given the considerable diversity of the 
"organisations herein, a one -size-fits-all regulation is not workabl e. On 25 February 2022, a "
"letter was sent to Parliament outlining the measures foreseen in the (semi)public sector, falling "
into three categories:  
 
1. A target figure for the (sub)top of ministries and their administrative agencies between 
"45% and 55% women, to be reached within five years;  "
2. A target figure of 50% women in the top of independent administrative bodies and advisory 
councils that are appointed by the national government;  
3. Government calls on the entire (semi)public sector to work towards 50% women in the 
"(sub)top, setting a statutory obligation to formulate ambitious target figures for remaining "
(administrative) organisations within the (semi)public sector.  
 
"Moreover, focus will be put on the development of an adequate infrastructure for monitoring and "
on sharing of good practices among large organisations within the (semi)public sector.  
 
To promote women’s labour market participation and more balance between paid and unpaid 
"(care) work in households, this government intensified the paid parental lea ve scheme. As of "
August 2022 parents get paid the first nine weeks of parental leave if taken up in the child’s first 
year. The parental leave amounts to 70% of the daily wage (given out by the Employee Insurance 
Agency).   
 
2. Strategic objective: Prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence  
 
2.1 Legislative changes   
The Netherlands is currently taking steps to expand criminal law protection against involuntary sex. 
"We are also looking at ways to criminalise sexual harassment. In  doing so, criminal law will be more "
in line with the Istanbul Convention. It is expected that the Draft Bill will be submitted to the 
Parliament in the second half of 2022.  
 
In addition a bill  is pending in the House of Representatives that aims to intro duce a discriminatory 
"purpose as a legal ground for aggravation of the sentence. Such discriminatory intent may include, "
"inter alia, the intent to express hatred or inferiority of a group of people because of their gender. "
"In that case, the statutory maxim um penalty for the predicate offence, such as femicide, can be "
increased by one third.

2.4 Research and awareness raising  
(2022)Research report on preventing gender -based violence against women and girls with 
disabilities . NGO Polio Plus supported by the OSCE office in Skopje and Ministry of labour and social 
policy.  
 
The research shows the real scope of the problem. Women and girls with disabilities tend to 
"experience discrimination from a very young age. It often begins within the family , then continues "
in all spheres of society in which they participate. A little less than half of women and girls with 
disabilities who participated in the research said they have directly experienced some form of 
"violence. One in three has witnessed violen ce or abuse. Their experiences are vastly underreported, "
however. Civil society organisations working with women who are victims of violence record on 
"average between one and three cases of violence against women and girls with disabilities per year, "
while  social work centres record only one or two cases annually.  
 
The Ministry of Labour and Social Policy within the Matra project “Implementation of the National 
Action Plan for the Istanbul Convention” funded by the Dutch Embassy in 2020 and 2021 conducted 
the following capacity building activities: - Developed modules for specialised services for women 
"and children, for perpetrators and for raising awareness among professionals; - Realised 3 training "
for trainers for a gender -based violence programme for spe cialised services for 3 modules; - Realised 
"3 training for providers of specialised services for victims of gender -based and domestic violence, "
"intended for the social work centres, the Institute for Social Services and representatives of civil "
society org anisations that provide specialised services for victims of gender -based and domestic 
violence.  
 
Following the Operational Plan of the Agency for Audio and Audio -visual Media Services for the 
"realisation of the Action Plan for the Istanbul Convention for 2020, training was conducted, intended "
for employees in the professional services of the Agency for Audio and Audio -visual Media Services 
and representatives of the self -regulatory body the Council of Media Ethics of Macedonia (CMEM). 
"17 GREVIO/Inf(2022)5 Namely, in 2020, the employees of the Agency and representatives of CMEM "
participated in the online Workshop for the media regulatory body and the self -regulatory body for 
"media ethics, for regulation, self -regulation and monitoring of the application of r eporting standards "
in cases of gender based violence in the media within the UFREX project “Freedom of Expression and 
"Freedom of the Media in RS Macedonia”, jointly implemented by the European Union and the "
Council of Europe.  
 
"In 2021, the Sector for Progr amme Affairs from the Department of Human Rights and Media Literacy "
attended training on gender -based violence intended for media professionals organised by HOPS - 
"Healthy Options Project Skopje, Margini and the National Network for Combating Violence agai nst "
"Women and Domestic Violence, within the project “Different discourse, better reality: media in "
combating gender -based violence – strengthening media literacy on gender -based violence”. The 
project was part of the UN Women Regional Programme on the Elim ination of Violence against

3.1 Legislative changes   
The Law on Prevention and Protection against Violence against Women and Domestic Violence 
"defines the competent institutions that deal with women victims of violence and domestic violence, "
"as follows: police officers, professionals from the social work centre, and the health institution and "
health workers. The social work centre starts the procedure after receiving information that gender 
"based violence against a woman or domestic violence has been committed ex officio, at the request "
"of the victim, upon a report from a citizen, official, institution and association. In cases where the "
victim is a child or a person that is unable to take care of themselves or a person with limited or 
"deprived le gal capacity, protection measures are taken whether with or without the consent of a "
parent or guardian. Measures for victim protection undertaken by the centre are as follows: provide 
"temporary care; ensures that the victim receives the necessary medical assistance and, if necessary, "
accompanies the victim to the nearest health institution; ensures that the victim exercises the right 
to social and health care in accordance with the law; provides appropriate psychosocial intervention 
and treatment; provides  the victim to receive psycho -social treatment in a counselling centre by 
"professionals in a social work centre, association, counselling centre for women victims of violence "
and other victims of domestic violence; provides assistance to the family for reg ular education of a 
child; provides legal aid and representation; directs the victim to the relevant state and other bodies 
responsible for economic empowerment of the victim and her active involvement in the labour 
"market through a competent employment ce ntre, and taking urgent protection measures in case of "
"high risk, as well as when the victim uses the services of temporary residence, and no later than 12 "
"hours from the receipt of the report, makes a decision for temporary entrustment of care and "
upbring ing of children to the parental victim.  
 
The application “Be Safe” made by a multi -sectoral working group has been published on the website 
of the Ministry of Interior. The main goal of the application is to strengthen the system for protection 
"and support  of all victims of gender -based violence, as well as to enable rapid reporting of gender -"
based violence and request assistance to the victim in conditions of the Covid -19 pandemic. The 
application contains important contacts of all -important institutions a nd organisations working on 
"issues of violence against women, including domestic violence, victim rights education, and "
information/advice for victims on what to do in case of violence. With the financial support of the 
"OSCE Mission, the Ministry of Interi or also produced flyers for victims of gender -based violence and "

3.3 Institu tional changes  
North Macedonia is a society that in recent years has been mobilised and organised to respond more 
effectively and professionally to violence against women and domestic violence. The basic 
framework for dealing with violence against women a nd domestic violence is the Action Plan for the 
implementation of the Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and 
Domestic Violence 2018 -2023” 1 and the Law on Prevention and Protection against Violence against 
"Women and Domestic Viol ence. 2 Also, a priority goal in the Strategic Plan of the MLSP3 within the "

"is the protection of victims from all forms of gender -based violence. In addition, g ender -based "
violence is included in the Gender Equality Strategy 2021 -2026 and is awaiting adoption after the 
Parliamentary procedure is completed. Following the ratification of the Convention for Prevention 
"and Combating Violence against Women, including domestic violence, the Ministry of Labour and "
Social Policy began preparing an Action Plan for implementing the Convention for Prevention and 
Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence. This plan is used to monitor the 
"dynamics of the alignment  of the national legislation with the provisions of the Convention, but also "
the fulfilment of the remaining obligations in terms of prevention of gender -based violence and 
"ensuring fast and efficient protection of the victims, and prosecution and punishme nt of the "
perpetrators. The Action Plan is a comprehensive multi -institutional policy for combating violence 
"against women, and these policies should be seen as an element of democratic and transparent "
governance based on the rule of law. The Action Plan f or the implementation of the Convention is a 
"strategic document of the Government of North Macedonia, which defines the activities, key "
224 
" institutions, indicators and time frame for incorporating the provisions of the Convention into "
national legislation for  the period 2018 -2023.  
 
For efficient implementation and functioning of the Law on Prevention and Protection against 
"Violence against Women and Domestic Violence, the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy adopted "

pronounced temporary protective measures; - Rulebook on the manner of conducting a risk 
assessment of danger to the life and physical and mental integrity of the victim and her family 
"members and the risk of recurrence of violence, proper risk management, implementation and "
monitoring of measures to protect women victims of gender -based violence and victims of domestic 
"violence, taken from the social work centre and the necessary forms.  "
 
Pursuant to Article  15 of the Law on Prevention and Protection against Violence against Women and 
"Domestic Violence, in 2021, the Government has established a National Co -ordination Body for "
Implementation of the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Viole nce19 with 
a five -year mandate. The National Co -ordination Body is chaired by the Minister of Labour and Social 
"Policy, and the administrative and professional work is performed by the Ministry of Labour and "

Article 4 of the Law on Prevention and Protection against Violence against Women and Domestic 
"Violence defines the principle of due diligence. In this way, the Law is harmonised with the guiding "
"principles of the Istanbul Convention, which is the principle of due diligence which creates a positive "
"obligation of the state for effective protection of the right to life. The principle of ""due diligence"" "
"defines the obligati on of institutions to promptly, urgently and under legal authority take all "
measures and authorisations to ensure the protection of the victim and to ensure fair compensation 
to victims or return to their original position before acts of violence. (This ch apter should be written 
according to the Criminal Code - Ministry of Justice.)  
 
"The risk assessment is performed by the police officers during the first contact with the victim, with "
"identification of the risk, description of the risk, clear formulation of  the risk, the reasons for its "
"occurrence, as well as the possible consequences of recurrence of violence.  "
 
The temporary urgent protection measure - removal of the perpetrator from the home and a ban 
on approaching the home - is imposed by the court for a  period of at least 10 and up to 30 days. In 
case the perpetrator refuses to leave the home voluntarily after receiving the decision on the

"In the Law on Foreigners from 2019 , 26 Article 112, which refers to the family reunification of a "
"foreigner with authorised residence in North Macedonia w ith another foreigner, in paragraph 1 "
"provides that on a request of the spouse, as well as of the child who has become an adult, and both "
have been authorised temporary residence in North Macedonia on the grounds of family 
"reunification in an interrupted d uration of at least four years, and who have not been authorised "
"temporary residence for the other reasons determined with this Law, shall be issued autonomous "
residence permit if they fulfil the general conditions for authorising residence. As an exceptio n to 
"paragraph 1 of this Article, in a case where the sponsor has died or the marriage has terminated, as "
"well as for particularly difficult circumstances of the persons referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, "
they may be issued an autonomous residence  permit if the temporary residence on grounds of family 
reunification has been with an uninterrupted duration of at least three years.  
 
"At the same time, in Article 116 of the same law, which prescribes the conditions for temporary "
"residence of a foreigner  who is a member of a nuclear family of a citizen of North Macedonia, in "
paragraph 4 is determined that the temporary residence of the person who is a member of a nuclear 
family of a citizen of North Macedonia may independently be extended in case the citi zen of the 
Republic of Macedonia passes away or the marriage is terminated after lasting for at least three 
"years on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia, as well as in cases when especially difficult "
circumstances require so.  
 
5.2 Policy changes  
The Law on International and Temporary Protection regulates when and which foreigners will be 
"granted refugee status. A person with a refugee status shall be a foreigner who, upon the "
"examination of their application, is granted refugee status and that is found to meet the conditions "
"set out in the Geneva Convention, i.e., a person who, owing to a well -founded fear of being "
"persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or "
"political opinion, is outside the cou ntry of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, "
"unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being "
"outside the country of his former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, i s unwilling to "
"return to it. Gender -related elements, which include gender identity, are considered when "
determining the membership or characteristics of a particular social group. A female person who has 
"been granted a refugee status has been identified a s a victim of sexual violence, while we have not "
identified female victims of violence who have received subsidiary protection.

5.5 Other pertinent developments  
Ministry of labour and social policy Department for equal opportunities develop plan with IOM office 
in Skopje to provide training during the October 2022 for the social workers and otter staff working 
in the Tabanovce and Gevgelija camp for refuges and migrant especially for the identification of 
victim of gender -based violence.  
 
6. Strategic objective: Achieve gender mainstreaming in all policies and measures  
 
6.1 Legis lative changes   
New National Strategy for Gender equality 2022 -2026 was develop and adopted from the 
Government and from the Parliament. In the new strategy for the first -time cover aria of climate 
change and women and sport as a one of the priorities.  
 
One of the priorities in this NS are gender mainstreaming policy in all programmes and projects in 
co-operation with all relevant institutions and international organisation in RNM.  
 
6.2 Policy changes  
The Gender and Climate Change TNA questionnaire was developed to examine the perceptions of 
the government units at national and local level in terms of climate change and its impact on men 
"and women. Respectively, the targeted groups were municipal councillors, equal opportunities co -"
"ordinators, and person s responsible for public procurement, environment and local economic "
"development, councillors, associates and officers from the Crisis Management Centres.  "
 
The training needs assessment is the first step towards the development of training programme 
"tailor ed in accordance with the needs of the target groups. Based on the findings of the analysis, a "
mixed team of experts on gender issues and climate change developed a training. The findings of 
this quantitative research have shown that there is still a need for capacity building related to the 
familiarity and knowledge among the respondents regarding the linkages gender and climate 
"change. However, it is worth noting that there has been a significant improvement regarding the "
perspective of the local governme nt units towards gender issues.  
 
"Into the bargain, the training needs analysis highlighted the rising need for capacity development in "
"the process of public procurement, more specifically sustainable public procurement, and gender "
"responsive public procure ment. In all likelihood, our current public procurement model is not "
delivering the best value. More than half of the respondents or 59% are not familiar with the impact 
of public procurement on climate change; 52% are not familiar with sustainable public procurement; 
68% are not familiar with gender integration concepts in public procurement.  
 
"Lastly, it is alarming that nearly half of the respondents have not attended training course on gender "
"and/or environment and climate change. Therefore, further awar eness raising and delivery of "
training is fundamental for enhanced understanding of the targeted groups regarding how gender 
and climate change intersect - in order to become an effective change maker for sustainable 
development.  
 
"Ultimately, gender inequ alities hinder sustainable development programmes for the administration "
officials at national and local level. The Gender Equality and Climate Change training programm e 
was updated and supplemented with green and gender public procurement. The training courses 
were attended by participants from all eight statistical regions in the country including Skopje. Two 
one-day training were organised with physical presence in Sko pje and six training courses were 
organised online via ZOOM.  
 
The training programme was consisted of five different sessions as follows:  
227 
 Session 1  – Climate change phenomena (What is climate change?; Adaptation and mitigation; The 
"influence of climate ch ange on men, women, children and vulnerable citizens);  "
Session 2  – Adaptation and mitigation of consequences of climate change (Measures for adaptation 
"and mitigation, Gender roles in the processes of adaptation and mitigation; Undertaken measures; "
Green procurement concept).  
Session 3  - Understanding of gender and sex and their interconnection to climate change 
phenomena (Gender identity; Gender neutrality; Gender roles and needs; The influence of gender 
roles and stereotypes on climate change)  
Session 4 - Introducing a gender perspective in public procurement (Incorporating a gender 
perspective into climate change policies; How to incorporate a gender perspective into public 
procurement)  
Session 5  – International and national strategic frame for gender and climate change (International 
standards and mechanisms that the country has ratified in the field of gender equality and national 
legal frame; International standards and mechanisms that the country has ratified in the field of 
environment and climate change and national legal frame; Action plan for gender and climate 
"change; Gender integration, statistics, inter -sectorial groups, SDGs, Gender mainstreaming; Aarhus "
Convention).  
 
"All these activities was implemented with support od UNDP office in Skopje,  Ministry of Labour and "
Social Policy and NGO Centre for research and policy as a part of gender mainstreaming policy’s.  
 
"Also, RNM have contact focal point for gender and climate change.  "
 
6.3 Institutional changes  
In the new Law for Gender equality which are in the final stage one of the article regulated 
establishment of new institution -Secretariat for gender equality in the Government of Republic of 
Macedonia. One of the priorities will be Gender mainstreaming policy’s.

1. Strategic objective: Prevent and combat gender stereotypes and sexism  
 
1.1 Legislative changes  
Sexual harassment  
The Government has suggested to ratify the ILO Convention No. 190 Eliminating Violence and 
Harassment in the World of Work. The Government has  also suggested several changes in the 
"Working Environment Act, to clarify the protection against sexual harassment. The suggestions "
contain  
 
 a statutory or regulatory fixing of the employer’s duty to establish a workplace policy on 
"preventing and handling  cases of sexual harassment,  "
 
 a suggestion to clarify the role of the workplace’s safety representative to ensure that the 
"employees’ working environment is ensured, and to make training of the representatives in "
handling cases of violence and harassment i n the workplace mandatory.  
 
The right to full time work  
The government proposed changes in the Working Environment Act to underline full time positions 
"as the norm in working life, to make it mandatory for employers to decide on and document the "
"need for part time work, and discuss this issue with union representatives, and to strengthen "
preferential right for part -time employees. Access to full time work is especially important to ensure 
economic independence and strengthen women’s position in the labour marked.  
 
Fathers’ rights to parental leave  
From August 2022 fathers’ rights to parental allowance is strengthened as fathers can take out 8 
"weeks paid leave, even though the mother does not fulfil the requirements for activity in the "
National Insurance Ac t. This change applies to cases where only the father has earned the right to 
parental allowance.  
 
1.2 Policy changes  
Sexual harassment  
The Government has started working on a White paper on sexual harassment. The White paper will 
map the scope of sexual harassment and suggest measures on important arenas such as in the labour 
"marked, in education and in culture and spare time arenas. The white paper will be presented in "
2024.  
 
Gender Equality in the labour market  
"The government has appointed a health personnel commission. Among other things, the "
"commission will identify recruitment challenges in various parts of the country, and the reaso ns for "
this. The need for a more even gender distribution among employees is part of this work. The 
commission will also give an account of the reasons for and use of part -time within the various 
"professions, including the extent to which part -time is volu ntary or involuntary. The commission will "
"point out structural changes that can reduce part -time use, investigate issues relating to full -time "
"and part -time, and propose changes that can reduce part -time use.  "
 
The government is working on a White paper on professional education in the university and college 
"sector, including teacher education, engineering education and health and social studies education.  "
The rapport will have an explicit gender perspective and propose solutions for how the government 
can f acilitate for more men to choose teacher education and health and social sciences education 
and more women to choose engineering education.  
 
229 
 Women’s’ health  
The government will present a strategy concerning women’s health. The strategy will consider 
"measur es for better examination, treatment and follow -up of women's health in the health service.  "
 
1.3 Institutional changes  
Men’s gender equality challenges and including men in gender equality work  
The government has appointed a commission to investigate gender equality challenges faced by 
boys and men which contribute to alienation and are an obstacle to a gender equal society.  
 
"The commission will assess issues concerning family, education, leisure, work, health, violence, "
"sexual harassment, queer people 's living conditions, negative social control and integration.  "
 
The committee will look at gender equality challenges in the light of norms for masculinity and 
"traditional gender roles, where this is relevant. The committee will also consider the major changes "
in the male gender role that have taken place in recent yea rs the commission will also propose 
solutions on how to encourage more men to choose female -dominated educations and professions.  
 
1.4 Research and awareness raising  
Sexual harassment  
The governments annual national conference on gender equality this year focused on what has 
"happened after #metoo. The conference aimed at sharing experiences from different sectors, "
"including schools, discussing what different stakeholders (including the government) have done to "
"prevent, protect and handle cases of sexual harassment, and to discuss and share good measures "
"and efforts. The conference lifted the issues from different perspectives, including sexual "
harassment targeting women with disabilities .  
 
The Norwegian Ministry of Defence is continuing their work to prevent sexual harassment through 
"among other things, developing a diversity plan, developing awareness -raising campaigns, and "
developing online training on whistle blowing.  
 
Gender Equality  in the labour market  
The Ministry of Culture and Equality has funded a new project to recruit more boys to the health 
and care education. The project is a one -year pilot with role model measures. Boys in secondary 
"school and upper secondary school are the  target group, but staff in the school will also gain "
increased knowledge about the problem. The University of Tromsø is carrying out the pilot.  
 
"As Norway holds the presidency of the Nordic council of ministers this year, one of the activities is a "
"Nordic conference taking place on 27 September, called A gender equal Nordic region – measures "
and solutions for future education and working market.  It will especially focus on gender equality in 
"the changing world of work, and on the gender segregated education and labour market.  "
 
A new study has looked at what can increase the proportion of female top managers in the private 
"sector. The study shows th at the competitive conditions for men and women are different, as "
women take on more care responsibilities. It reduces the probability of both having a position at a 
"high level, with responsibility for results, and a high income. Men more often have partne rs who "
"work less and who take more responsibility at home, thus they have better conditions to continue "
working more and to say yes to exciting job opportunities with more responsibility and pay.

1.2 Policy changes  
National Action Programme for Equal Treatment for 2022 -2030 was adopted in May 2022 to 
integrate the principle of equal treatment into national policies. The programme sets out the 
"objectives and priorities of activities for equal treatment, and its aim is to eliminate discrimination "
from social life in Poland to the highest possible degree.  Actions include in particular raising social 
awareness in the field of equal treatment and counteracting breaches of the principle of equal 
treatment. The Programme is a multi -annual programme which sets out in a strategic manner the 
objectives and priori ties of activities in the field of equal treatment. The individual priorities of this

"diagnosis and training in their regions. As part of the programme, diagnostic surveys of the mental "
"well-being of pupils, parents, teachers and professionals were carried out in a random sample of "
"1,200 schools across Poland. The quantitative research resulted in the development of six diagnostic "
reports concerning the quality of life of pupils at different levels of education and the psychosocial 
factors determining the level of quality of life in this group. The reports also concern the support 
"provided to children and adolescents by parents and teachers, as well as specialists (psychologists "

"scope of unpaid care work at home, their children’s home -based schooling, caring for elderly family "
"members at higher risk of infection, and significantly greater restrictions on movement. Therefo re, "
it would be very important in the coming period to pay attention to the valuation of unpaid domestic 
work and the establishment of an effective methodology at the global level that would enable a 
"unique way of measuring and valuing this type of work. I n this sense, the Republic of Serbia would "
appreciate the support from countries that are more experienced in this field as well as co -operation 
with them.

Balance Directive and addressed the challenges of the pandemics for work -life balance and gender 
equality.  
 
2. Strategic objective: Prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence  
 
2.2 Policy changes  
In 2022 we are preparing a new Resolution on the National Programme for Prevention of Violence 
"against Women and Domestic Violence, which sets out the goals, measures and key bodies "
responsible for the implementation of policies for the prevention and redu ction of domestic 
violence. its purpose will be to recognise key fields where deficiencies or poor performance in the 
"field of prevention of violence against women and domestic violence have been detected, and to "
define objectives and measures for their im provement. Measures for the implementation of 
provisions of the Istanbul Convention will also be included. The key changes which we want to 
achieve by realising the objectives and accompanying measures after the Resolution expires are: (1) 
"high quality, di verse and widely available programmes of assistance and protection of victims of "
"domestic violence and women victims of violence, (2) improved protection, treatment, and situation "
"of victims of such violence, (3) highly trained professional staff and exper ts who face the issue of "
"domestic violence and violence against women in their work, (4) greater awareness in society about "
"the issue and achieving a higher level of zero tolerance to such violence, (5) improved regulations in "
"the field of prevention of do mestic violence and violence against women, (6) provision of quality "
data about domestic violence and violence against women and (7) improved organisation in the 
fields of prevention of domestic violence and violence against women. All these goals are comp liant 
with the fundamental European guidelines in the field of prevention and treatment of domestic 
violence and violence against women. It is expected to be adopted by the end of this year.  
 
"Also, to be defined are indicators for monitoring the implementa tion of the Resolution and "
stakeholders who will implement individual measures. Monitoring the implementation of the 
Resolution will be the obligation of all line ministries responsible for individual measures. Once a 
"year, the line ministries will report on the realisation of the objectives of the Resolution and "
implementation of measures to the relevant ministry. A precise timeline for the implementation of 
"measures will be defined in biannual action plans, which will be drafted after the adoption of the "
Resolution by the inter -ministerial working group which was established in 2018 to draft the 
"Resolution, and which also features representatives of NGOs active in the field of prevention of "
domestic violence and violence against women. It is expected to be  adopted by the end of this year.

2.4 Research and awareness raising  
"On the basis of Article 111 of the Social Assistance Act37 (hereinafter referred to as: ZSV), databases "
"of CSDs contain the following data about victims and perpetrators: first and last name, birth data, "
"sex, personal identification number, data on citizenship, data on residence permit for foreigners, "
"residence d ata, data relating to family relations (number of family members, type of family, "
"relationship between the person concerned), data on the household, data referring to the type of "
"partnership community (marriage or cohabitation), data on status (data on sch ooling, employment, "
"retirement, and other), data on education, data on medical condition and disability, data on wages "
"and other income and receipts, data on property, data social hardship and problems suffered by "
"individuals, families and population group s, data on exemption from the payment of services, tax "
"identification number, number of current account or another account, data relating to housing and "
"living conditions. Specific databases may also contain information other than personal data, such as, "
"for example, the number of conducted proceedings, provision of first social assistance and other "
services and data about re -victimisation or repeating of a violent act in previous or current 
"relationship. A sector for informatics has been established at the  MDDSZ, which is responsible for "
"planning, creating, maintaining and developing databases. Databases on violence contain the "
"following data: number of cases, analysis by age and type of violence, relationship of the perpetrator "
"to the victim by sex, number  of measures, multi -disciplinary teams, analysis of referrals and when "
violence in the given case started.  
 
"In addition to collecting data on the basis of the act regulating social protection, CSDs are also obliged "
to collect data on the basis of Article 30 of the ZPND. They are responsible for processing personal 
data and managing databases of persons that pursuant to the Act were dealt with as victims and 
"those dealt with as perpetrators of violence, with the purpose of providing assistance to the victim , "
"to deal with the perpetrator of violence, to create an assistance plan for the victim together with its "
"implementation and monitoring, and for use in scientific, research and statistical purposes.  "
 
"On 25 November 2021, International Day for the Eliminat ion of Violence Against Women, Slovenian "
Presidency of the Council of the European Union organised a High -level Webinar: Building safe digital 
spaces for women and girls - Click off cyber violence!. The webinar was a great opportunity to 
address many issue s related to cyber violence and harassment which is becoming ever more present 
in our society and to share mutual experience and best practices on how to build safe digital spaces 
"for all, including women and girls.  "
 
The main conclusions were:  
 
- There is a political will to address and combat cyber violence and there is an understanding 
that a gender perspective in combating cyber violence must be addressed.  
- Europe is currently lacking a holistic framework to define and combat violence against 
women and girls in all its forms.  
"- The world’s most democratic countries are already in decline when it comes to online abuse, "
"however we must not forget that online abuse is gendered, since it affects women and girls "
"disproportionately, but the legal response is o ftentimes gender neutral, which makes legal "
persecution of offenders much more difficult.  
- The society has a hard time accepting that cyber violence is as real as physical violence; the 
research shows that there is no separation between online and offline  world when it comes to 
"violence against women. Moreover, often cyber violence leads to physical violence, when not "
properly addressed.  
                                                           
"37 (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia [ Uradni list RS ], Nos. 3/07  – official consolidated version 23/07 – "
"amended, 41/07 – amended,  61/10 – ZSVarPre, 62/10 – ZUPJS, 57/12, 39/16, 52/16 – ZPPreb -1, 15/17 – DZ, "
"29/17, 54/17, 21/18 – ZNOrg, 31/18 – ZOA-A and 28/19)  "
263 
 - Gender -based violence places large costs on the economy and on the society. The estimate 
"cost of gender -based violenc e in the EU is 366 billion EUR each year, the cost of cyber violence is "
estimated at around 89 billion EUR each year.  
 
2.5 Other pertinent developments   
In March 2022 a new strategy paper in the field of social protection was adopted - Resolution on the 
National Social Security Programme 2022 -2030 (ReNPSV2 -30). The national programme foresees the 
"development of services and programmes in the field of social protection, which also includes and "
intertwines the area of prevention of violence against women an d domestic violence. Among other 
"things, it is envisaged to strengthen the network of crisis centres for children and adolescents "
"(especially for children under the age of 6) and for adult victims of violence, with a particular focus "
"on identifying the nee ds of individual vulnerable groups (e.g., the elderly, people with disabilities). "
Strengthening and training of practitioners for these tasks and carrying out new employments. It is 
"also envisaged to achieve a greater level of visibility of the service ass isting victims of crime, "
strengthening the skills of practitioners and better co -operation and liaison with other stakeholders 
in this area with a view to providing the best possible support to victims of crime. The development 
"of social security programme s (including violence prevention) is also envisaged, with particular "
attention to the expansion of the network of programmes and the expansion of existing programmes 
in the light of rapidly changing user needs. The transition of annual public programmes to  the public 
"network is also envisaged, allowing stable funding for contractors.  "
 
6. Strategic objective: Achieve gender mainstreaming in all policies and measures  
 
6.4 Research and awareness raising  
In 2022 we have organised a training for co -ordinators  for equal opportunities of women and men 
at the ministries.  The aim was to present methods and key tools for the effective integration of the 
"gender mainstreaming (GM) perspective, taking into account the latest EU findings and the analyses "
of its agencies.  
 
Content of the training:  
 
1. Interactive introductory part: overview on how the gender perspective is included in the work of 
individual ministries;  
2. Theoretical part: basic concepts and methods and tools for the effective implementation of GM ;  
3. Practical examples: how to carry out a gender impact assessment;  
4. Discussion: feedback and concrete proposals for further training.  
 
In 2022 also a specific training for public officials working at the Ministry of interior and the Police 
was organi sed. 
 
Police conducted training for students at the Police College on gender mainstreaming.  
 
The Ministry of the Interior has established a Consultative Body gender Mainstreaming in the 
"Ministry of the Interior and the Police, with the aim of ensuring and implementing the integration of "
"the mainstreaming gender in their work. In the consultative body, members are represented at all "
"levels of the organisation, which enables greater awareness among employees in this area. The "
members perform their tasks in ac cordance with the decision of the minister.  
 
  
264 
  
6.5 Other pertinent developments . 
"In 2022, Ministry of Public administration started to prepare a methodology for assessing the effects "
"of regulations on different social areas, which explicitly states in chapter VI entitled ""Assessment of "
"social impacts"" that the impact on the situation o f women and on gender equality should also be "
"taken into account when introducing policies/regulations. This means that, with its adoption, it will "
make the assessment of the effects of the regulations on gender mandatory or systemic in nature.  
 
7. Main challenges and lessons learned  
 
 
Challenges and lessons learned stayed the same as years before (see below).  
 
1. Progress on gender equality still too slow  
Although significant progress has been made in achieving gender equality and empowerment of 
"women in many areas, particularly in legislation, barriers to substantive gender equality still exist. "
"The changing of social and cultural patterns is a long -term process, and actual gender equality cannot "
be achieved through short -term measures.  
 
Persiste nt gender differences require the continuous elimination of barriers to the full participation 
"of women in the labour market and in political, public and economic/financial decision -making. It is "
also important to combat deeply rooted and newly emerging ge nder stereotypes that determine 
women's and men's roles in society and create a gender imbalance in paid and unpaid work. 
"Therefore, we will continue to focus our efforts on creating conditions for a more balanced division "
of family obligations between wom en and men.  
 
The existing systemic regulation of equality between women and men still does not ensure actual 
gender equality in bodies governed by public law. Despite the declared equality between women 
"and men, the figures show that we have not yet achieved a balanced gender representation in "
"specific areas of social life, particularly in decision -making positions in politics, the economy and "
"bodies governed by public law; therefore, in 2019 amendments to the Equal Opportunities for "
Women and Men Act  are being drafted. One of the important challenges that remains is also gender 
"balance in economic decision -making, since there are only few women CEOs in the biggest Slovenian "
"companies. To this end, Slovenia is planning to propose legal measures in this  area.  "
 
2. Backlash against gender equality  
One of the challenges gender equality policy will have to deal with in the future is to make its 
"achievements more visible and recognised as a democratic norm. It has been noticed that, "
"irrespective of the developme nt of human rights and standards, gender equality advocates and their "
initiatives to further improve the status of women and men in our society often encounter negative 
attitudes. Radical movements (that are trying to re -establish society without dated vie ws on gender 
"equality, human rights and equalities in general) are very successful at promoting the so -called "
"gender theory conspiracy and attacking women’s rights, advocates and activists.  "
 
3. Limited resources and political commitment  
"Another challenge that the Equal Opportunities Department in Slovenia is facing, is firstly general "
lack of financial and human resources for gender equality which could have a negative impact on the 
realisation of gender equality and the empowerment of wo men and girls in the future; and secondly 
additional tasks related to other inequalities and discrimination. Challenges which always remains 
for the area of gender equality is a political commitment to and lack of understanding of the issue.  
 
Additional t asks related to other inequalities and discrimination have been conferred to the main 
"national gender equality mechanism in Slovenia. As a consequence, lack of financial and human "
resources for gender equality could have a negative impact on the realisatio n of gender equality 
265 
 agenda and the empowerment of women and girls in the future. Challenges which always remains 
for the area of gender equality is a political commitment to the agenda.  
 
For more efficient implementation of gender equality policy and in order to ensure greater 
"autonomy and more efficient functioning of the national mechanism for gender equality, the "
competent authority should be strengthened and given a position of influence in the government’s 
hierarchy and/or its organisational structur e To ensure that the principle of gender equality is 
"followed by all ministries and state institutions, the status of co -ordinators within the ministries "
should be strengthen and gender budgeting should be applied at different levels.

1. Strategic objective: Prevent and combat gender stereotypes and sexism  
 
1.1 Legislative changes  
" In relation with the participatory process , promoted by the Ministry of Equality and the Institute of "
"Women , to reform Constitutional Act 2/2010 on Sexual and Reproductive Health and the Voluntary "
"Interruption of Pregnancy , the Council of Ministers approved to send the draft reform bill to the "
"Parliament, on 30 August.  "
 
"Regarding this subject matter, Constitutional Law 4/2022, of April 12, modifies the Penal Code in order to "
penalise harassment to women who attend clinics for the voluntary interruption of pregnancy38 .  
 
" Law 13/2022 of 7 July, on Audio -visual Communication .39 Reference must be made to article 6 of this Law "
"that deals with gender equality and women’s image, aiming to ensure that audio -visual communication "
conveys an equal and non -discriminatory image of women and men and do es not directly or indirectly 
"favour discrimination based on sex, inequality of women or incite sexual or gender violence. The law also "
"promotes the production of audio -visual works directed or produced by women, also promoting the "
"training, attraction and  retention of female talent in this sector. Moreover, in independent production, "
providers of linear and on -demand television audio -visual communication services must allocate 30% to 
works directed or created exclusively by women.  
 
" Law 15/2022, of 12 July, comprehensive for equal treatment and non -discrimination40. It is important to "
highlight the definition and regulation of multiple and intersectional discrimination and of positive actio n 
"measures that take into account this specific type of discrimination, due to their importance for the "
"development of equality policies aimed at women, who are especially vulnerable to this type of "
discrimination.   
 
" Royal Decrees to regulate the curriculum for Early Childhood Education, Primary Education, Compulsory "
"Secondary Education and Baccalaureate  (RD 95/2022,41 RD 157/2022 ,42 RD 217/2022 ,43 and RD "
24443/2022 ) have been approved. Among their objectives is the promotion of effective equality between 
"men and women. All areas of knowledge at the different educational levels, incorporate contents on "
comprehensive sexuality education and education for citizenship ( gender stereotypes and sexism).  
 
" Royal Decree 634/202245, 26 July. It regulates the direct grant from the Ministry of Equality to various "
"entities for the social and labour insertion of women and girls who are victims of trafficking, sexual "
"exploitation and women in contexts of prostitution, within the framework of the Recovery, "
Transformation and Resilience Plan.

" Law 17/2022, 5 September, modifies Law 14/2011, on Science, Technology and Innovation .47 The gender "
perspective is reinforced throughout the regulatory text and is given legal certainty as it is included in 
"articles 4bis and 4ter. Reference shoul d be made to articles 21 and 22, where temporary contracts "
"(predoc. and postdoc) are suspended/extended for any situation related to care, including leaves of "
absence and reduction in working hours.

267 
"  Royal Decree 636/2022, of 26 July, which regulates the S ocial Inclusion Sea l48. The actions that enable "
"the Seal to be awarded must integrate, among others the principle of equality between women and men, "
"equal opportunities for all people, without discrimination on grounds of sex.  "
 
 The Supreme Court's Judgment  2944/2022 of 14 July 2022  is worth highlighting. It considers the 
"requirement for women to have a minimum height of 1,60 metres in order to be admitted to the selective "
"tests for entry into the National Police Corps, an indirect discrimination against wom en with respect to "
"men, who are required to have a less demanding minimum height (1.65 metres), since the percentage of "
women (25%) is much higher than that of men (3%) who do not reach the required height.  
 
1.2 Policy changes  
The Women's Institute in collaboration with the Labour Ministry and social partners has developed the tools 
and guides established in the new legislation approved in 2020 on gender equality plans and gender pay

"It has also continued developing the  Innovatia 8.3 Program me, already mention ed in the previous report,  that "
"has been selected as national winner in the 2022 edition of the European Enterprise Promotion Awards, in "
"Category 6 - Responsible and Inclusive Entrepreneurship -. In addition, due to the success of  the School for "
"Women Entrepreneurs “Juana Millán” , its budget has been increased and its development has expanded.  "
 
"In the justice sector, there are current ongoing initiatives aimed at fostering equality and work -life balance. "
"The so -called Justice 2030 Plan  includes, among its different measures, the elaboration and subsequ ent "
approval of a specific equality plan tailored to the civil servants of the Administration of Justice. Another plan 
is on its way to promote rules that facilitate work -life balance such as the creation of a framework for remote 
work.  
 
1.3 Institutional changes . 
The Advisory Board for Caregiving established in 2021 by the Ministry of Equality has continued 
working on its two main goals: preparing a Base Document that could inspire a future State Care

"Efficiency of the Public Justice Service, that will amend the Organic Law 6/1985 of the Judiciary, "
"aims at transforming the structure of the judiciary i n order to facilitate access to justice, bringing "
public justice services closer to citizens regardless of where they live. Special attention is given 
to women victims of violence.   
 
This Plan improves women's access to justice by guaranteeing its availability throughout the 
"territory, including rural areas, its accessibility to women with disabilities, and using information "
and communication technologies such as judicial proceedings by videoconference.  
 
" Royal Decree 586/2022, of 19 July ,66 amends the Regulation on free legal aid, establishing among "
the requirements to be able to provide legal assistance as well as for law professionals who

"the application of the principle of equality between women and men and gender violence, and "
"specific training on the CEDAW, on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European "
"Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), as wel l on other gender equality issues such as gender "
"mainstreaming, inclusive language, recent case -law of the Supreme Court on gender violence, "
"gender -based cybercrime, sexual violent crimes.  "

International Protection Reception System.  
" The gender sensitive approach is included in every aspect in the Humanitarian Care Programme, "
and especially in the design and characteristics of the reception and humanitarian care resources. 
The number and the q uality of these resources has been increased in recent months. The 
"humanitarian care programme has specific places for victims of trafficking. As a matter of fact, "
"there are 210 places managed by four different entities. These places are based in: Seville,  Cádiz, "
"Córdoba and Almería in Andalusia; Teruel, in Aragón; Las Palmas, in the Canary Islands; and Bilbao, "

274 
 6. Strategic objective: Achieve gender mainstreaming in all policies and measures  
 
6.2 Policy changes  
6.3 Institutional changes  
6.4 Research and awareness raising  
" The III Strategic Plan for the Effective Equality of Women and Men 2022 -2025 , was approved "
"by the Council of Ministers on March 8, 2022. It sets out the policy agenda for gender equality "
for the next four years (2022 -2025).  
 
"The Plan is structured around four main lines of action: 1. Good Governance, to move  towards "
"a more inclusive and democratic model of government, aiming to ensure that all public policies "
"are gender -sensitive; 2. Economy for life and the fair distribution of wealth, against the "
"feminisation of poverty and precariousness,  focuses specifica lly on the deepest gaps and "
concentrates 91% of the plan's financial resources on measures for decent employment and the 
"reduction of wage and pension gaps, as well as joint responsibility for care; 3. Lives for women "
"free from male violence, with the aim of strengthening institutional co -ordination and response "
systems for early detection and comprehensive care for victims of violence by a partner or 
"former partner, sexual violence, sexual exploitation and trafficking; 4. To ensure all women can "
"effectivel y exercise their rights in all areas of life, including measures to respond to the needs of "
women who suffer from multiple or intersectional discrimination.  
"As stated in the Plan, in relation with the first line of action (Good Governance), in order to "
"systematically incorporate the gender perspective, it is necessary to further strengthen training "
"on equality issues for the personnel of the General State Administration, as well to strengthen "
"and consolidate co -ordination and collaboration within and among  Ministries, and of the "
"different institutional mechanisms for gender mainstreaming, such as the equality units of "
"Ministries and the Interministerial Equality Commission, proposing different measures to that "
end.  
 Within the framework of the collaboration agreement between the Women's Institute and the 
"Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces (FEMP) (July 2022), the online “Municipal "
"School for Equality”  for the implementation of equality plans at a local level to train, advice and "
"support the inc orporation of the gender perspective in local policies, both for technical and "
"political staff in charge of municipal management, was presented on October 6, 2022. A Guide "
"on Good Practices for the incorporation of the gender perspective at a local level, was also "
presented.  
 
 
  
275 
 Sweden  
 
1. Strategic objective: Prevent and combat gender stereotypes and sexism  
 
1.1 Legislative changes . 
The governmental decided in 2018 to review what measures are needed to ensure compliance with 
the provisions on active measures in the Discrimination Act including the supervisory responsibility 
over the Discrimination Act when it comes to activities accor ding to the Schools Act.  
 
The inquiry on certain issues in the Discrimination Act (2021:94) assessed that the protection of 
employees against harassment and sexual harassment from third parties needs to be strengthened. 
The inquiry therefore proposed that  the Discrimination Act should be clarified so that it is clear that 
employers must also work actively against harassment and sexual harassment from third parties.  
 
The specific provision on hate speech (agitation against a population group) does not cover  sexist 
"speech. However, the Swedish Criminal Code (1962:700) contains other provisions that may be "
applied to hateful speech including when sexist in nature. There is for instance a Chapter on 
"defamation that includes a provision on insulting behaviour (C hapter 5 Section 3), which applies to "
"a person who directs accusation, a derogatory statement or humiliating conduct at another person "
"is, if the act is liable to violate the other person’s self -esteem or dignity.  "
 
It should also be mentioned that a commit tee of inquiry is tasked to consider whether crimes where 
a motive has been that the victim is of a certain gender or has a certain gender identity should be 
seen as an aggravating circumstance explicitly mentioned in the Swedish Criminal Code.  
 
1.2 Policy changes  
The government has taken a series of measures aimed at countering sexual harassment and sexual 
"violence. For example, in the joint regulatory letter for 2018, state universities and colleges were "
tasked with making visible their preven tion and promotion work to counter sexual harassment. The 
University and Higher Education Council (UHR) was also tasked with collectively making visible the 
work of higher education institutions to prevent sexual harassment and their work when they 
become aware of suspected sexual harassment.  
 
"With regard to working life, the government tasked the Discrimination Ombudsman and the Work "
Environment Agency to produce information and implement training efforts for employers to 
strengthen the prevention and skills -enhancing work against sexual harassment.  
 
A Commission for gender equal lifetime earnings has been tasked with submitting proposals aimed 
at increasing economic equality between women and men in the long term. The commission has 
"submitted proposals  for measures that contribute to promoting equal wages, equal living incomes, "
an equal distribution of public support measures to women and men and equal workplaces. The 
"assignment was finally reported on February 7, 2022 ""Reduce the gap - Measures for equ al lifetime "
"incomes"". An interim report was submitted on January 25, 2021.  "
 
Two Commission proposals which have been commissioned by the previous government are:  
 
1) Follow -up of how the gender equality perspective has been incorporated into annual reports  and 
budget documents  
The Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority will follow up authorities' compliance with the 
regulation on annual reports and budget documents from an equality perspective. The assignment 
includes reviewing annual reports and budget do cuments for 2021 and 2022 from a selection of the 
authorities that are part of the government's development programme “Gender mainstreaming in 
276 
 government agencies”. The assignment will be reported to the Government Office no later than June 
"15, 2023.  "
 
2) Assignment to make gender equality analyses of salary income and other income  
The Mediation Institute has a government mandate to carry out gender equality analyses of salary 
income and other income that affects individuals' disposable income over their li fetime. In a first 
"step, the mediation institute must carry out a gender equality analysis of salary income and other "
income. The authority will also submit proposals on how gender equality analyses of wage income 
"and other income can be carried out regula rly. In addition to salary income, the assignment includes "
"an analysis of how returns from capital, business income/business income and transfers are "
distributed between women and men. The result should compare incomes between groups and 
sectors and highli ght how income differences between women and men can look for different 
groups in society.  
 
This includes analysing:  
- development over time  
- how income differences look in different parts of the labour market  
"- how the income gap looks for different groups in the population (for example by age, region of "
"birth, length of stay in Sweden of those born abroad).  "
 
"The former Government also launched during the Spring 2022 a reform for Flexibility, Adaptability "
and Security in the labour market. This reform  will have substantial positive impact on both gender 
equality and for the transition to a green economy. The reform implies that we will legislate on the 
right to full -time work. This means that full -time work will become the norm and part -time work the 
"exception. This is of course especially important to women, as some 26 percent of women in Sweden "
today work part -time and the most common reason for this is that they cannot get a full -time 
employment.  
 
The reform package will also address the issue of lif e-long learning. Everyone in Sweden who has 
worked for more than eight years will be given the opportunity to study for up to one year with 
financing providing at least 80 per cent of their previous income up to a maximum amount.  
 
"In Sweden foreign -born wo men have a lower employment rate than domestic -born women, which "
"also contributes to economic inequality. Therefore, the Government intends to work to increase "
foreign -born women's opportunities to enter the labour market. It is an important step towards b oth 
reduced segregation and giving all women and men the same opportunities and conditions in terms 
"of paid work, which leads to greater economic equality. An investigation is currently underway that "
"will propose improved labour market establishment for fo reign -born women. Furthermore, the "
"Equality Agency, the Swedish Social Insurance Agency, the Swedish Migration Agency, the National "
Board of Health and Welfare and the County Administrative Board Västernorrland have been tasked 
with drawing up a joint agen cy plan to increase the entry of foreign -born women into the labour 
market.  
 
1.3 Institutional changes  
Harassment and sexual harassment is discrimination and prohibited in several areas of society. There 
are special requirements for employers or educational providers to act when someone is exposed in 
"the workplace, school or university. Employers and training providers must also work preventively.  "
 
"If you are subjected to harassment or sexual harassment in an activity covered by the law, you can "
make a report to the Equality Ombudsman.  
 
Employers and training providers must implement active measures to prevent all forms of 
"discrimination, for example harassment and sexual harassment. The work must be carried out "
277 
" continuously in four stages: investi gate, analyse, remedy and follow up. This could, for example, "
involve reviewing conversational climate and jargon.  
 
"The Discrimination Act does not regulate all areas of society, nor what happens between private "
"individuals when it comes to, for example, h ow neighbours or relatives treat each other. The content "
"of advertising, TV, radio, social media and newspapers are not covered by the Discrimination Act. "
"There are, however, other laws and regulations that set limits for, for example, actions between "
private individuals and for what may be written and said in advertising and the media.  
 
1.4 Research and awareness -raising  
Statistics Sweden (SCB) compiles statics in relation to the working environment which covers 
physical and psychosocial work environment  conditions and how they have changed over time. The 
"result is reported by profession, industry, socio -economic division, age and gender. The survey is a "
supplementary survey to the Labour Force Surveys (AKU).  
 
"Both agencies, the Swedish National Council f or Crime Prevention (Brå) and Statistics Sweden (SCB) "
publishes reports with sex -disaggregated statistics. The Swedish National Council for Crime 
"Prevention annually produce the Swedish Crime Survey (SCS), a survey on, inter alia, victimisation of "
"assault,  sexual offences, threats, harassment and online harassment among the Swedish population "
(16-84 years). SCS -data is sex - and age -disaggregated but the survey questions relating to sexual 
offences and harassment do not specify its manifestations (e.g. it do es not differentiate between 
"sexual offences as physical incidents or oral or written sexually offensive comments, and does not "
specify whether harassments were of sexual nature). Every two years The Swedish National Council 
"for Crime Prevention (Brå) also  produce the Politician’s Safety Survey (PTU), which measures the "
"extent and consequences of harassment, threats and violence experienced by elected "
representatives who are exposed in their capacity as elected representatives. The PTU -data is sex -
"disaggreg ated, and respondents are asked to respond to questions concerning self -reported "
"victimisation during the previous year, including whether there was any verbal, written or physical "
attack of sexual nature in conjunction with the incidents.  
 
Statistics Sweden publishes its report ‘Women and men in Sweden - facts and figures’ every two 
years. All statistics in the reports are sex disaggregated. The reports present the results from analysis 
"and surveys about men and women in several different areas, for ex ample unpaid home and care "
"work as well as men’s violence against women. Furthermore, in 2020 Statistics Sweden was "
commissioned to carry out a pilot study with the aim of testing a new approach for a time -use survey 
among women and men that has been condu cted every ten years since 1990. The statistics from the 
survey provide a picture of people's everyday lives and show how the population divides their time 
"into various activities, such as leisure and homework activities. The statistics show differences in  "
"women's and men's time use, but also how time use varies in the different phases of life.  "
 
1.5 Other pertinent developments . 
"The Swedish Crime Victim Authority’s campaign against online hate speech, including sexist hate "
speech. The Government commissioned the agency in 2021 to implement the campaign. The 
"campaign is mainly channelled online, but signs have also physically been placed outdoors and on "
"public transport. The campaign directs you to a website with information regarding what is crimi nal, "
how to report and what support is available. One of the main points which is raised for awareness 
as well as causes for crime is sexual harassment which includes sexist behaviour or sexist hate speech 
towards another individual.  
 
In 2019 the Governmen t commissioned the Equality Ombudsman to implement awareness -raising 
"initiatives to raise the knowledge about measures and offensive special treatment, including work "
against sexual harassment. The government also commissioned the Swedish Gender Equality A gency 
"to collect and spread knowledge about sexual harassment, with a particular focus on the situation "
278 
" of children and young people. The agency has gathered information and links to guidelines, manuals, "
"checklists and advise aimed at professionals, guardi ans, leaders within associations or anyone who "
has a role in responding to the vulnerable and preventing sexual harassment and abuse from 
"occurring on its webpage. The types of guidelines, manuals and checklist include:  "
 
" Guidelines, manuals and checklists on children and young people's rights and that are aimed "
at children and young people themselves.  
" Guidelines, manuals, and checklists regarding where to find support which are aimed at "
adults.  
" Guidelines, manuals and checklists for trade unions, authoritie s, and employers' "
organisations. The aim is to support the work against sexual harassment at work and gives 
information about the Discrimination Act in relation to working life.  
" Guidelines, manuals and checklists for preschools, schools, universities, and  colleges as well "
"as many other types of education, both municipal and private. The aim is to spread "
"information about the School Act and the curriculum, as well as in the Discrimination Act "
and the Work Environment Act.  
 
An example from the civil society includes The Friends foundation which examines safety of schools 
around the country every year. The report also provides information about groups of children and 
"young people who are particularly vulnerable, and who we particularly need to strengthen. The most "
"common forms of harassment are, among other things, linked to ethnicity, sexual orientation, and "
disability. https://friends.se/report/friendsrapporten -2022/  
 
2. Strategic objective: Prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence  
 
2.1 Legislative changes  
The government has implemented and announced several initiatives to strengthen criminal law 
protection against men's violence against women.  
 
"On 1 January 2022, the minimum penalty for gross violation of a woman's integrity and gr oss "
violation of integrity was increased from nine months to imprisonment for one year (and at most six 
"years). Moreover, the scale of penalties for breaches of non -contact orders was amended from a "
fine or imprisonment for at most one year to imprisonment  for (at least 14 days and) at most one 
year. The former rule of freedom from responsibility was replaced with a provision to the effect that 
in minor cases the penalty is a fine.  
 
"In February 2022, the Swedish government appointed a committee of inquiry to review the "
"protection under criminal law for children aged 15 –17 against sexual violations, especially in relation "
"to purchases of sexual acts, and review whether the legislative text should clarify that certain child "
pornography crimes are documented a ssaults on children by amending the legal classification. The 
inquiry will also consider whether it should be seen as an aggravating circumstance when a motive 
for a crime is that the victim is of a certain gender or has a certain gender identity (dir. 202 2:7).  
 
On 1 June 2022 the criminal offence honour -based oppression entered into force. The criminal 
offence includes a person who commits certain criminal acts against a person and a motive was to 
preserve or restore the honour of a person or of an immedia te or wider family or some other similar 
group. The penalty for the offence is imprisonment for at least one year and at most six years.  
 
2.2 Policy changes  
Within Sweden’s ‘National strategy for combating and preventing men’s violence against women 
"and honour -related violence and repression’, the government adopted a national violence "
prevention programme in June 2022. This programme includes policies and plans for several areas 
"and agencies to combat sexism and stereotypical, sexist norms. The programm e also explicitly "
279 
 recognises the importance of challenging the views of power and masculinity early to prevent 
stereotypical perceptions of masculinity and femininity which increase the tendency for violence.  
 
A regulation has been introduced in the Swedish Social Services Act stipulating that social welfare 
committees must work to help people who have subjected close relatives to violence or other abuses 
to change their behaviour. The legislative changes to the laws entered into force on 1 August 202 1. 
 
A regulation on state grants to women's and girls' shelters and certain other non -profit organizations 
was introduced in September 2021. The government has decided to make the state grants 
permanent.  
 
The government will draw up a new action programme for 2024 -2026.  
 
2.3 Institutional changes  
A permanent national and cross -sectoral competence centre against violence and oppression in the 
name of so -called honour was established in 2022. The centre w ill support and contribute to 
"strategic, preventive and knowledge -based work against honour -related violence and oppression at "
"national, regional and local level. Among other things, the centre will support municipalities and "
"regions in their work to intro duce, monitor and evaluate working methods and methods for the "
support of the vulnerable. The centre will also regularly investigate the extent of honour -related 
violence and oppression in Sweden and the development of society's efforts in the area. An 
additional task is to gather and disseminate knowledge about honour -related violence and 
oppression based on research and proven experience.  
 
2.4 Research and awareness -raising  
"The Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention (Brottsförebyggande rådet, or  Brå for short) has "
been instructed by the government to study what measures can be taken in society to combat 
intimate partner violence among young people. Brå was also instructed to describe the causal 
"mechanisms behind such violence, identify preventive  and supportive measures and highlight gaps "
in the knowledge on the basis of Swedish and international research (Brå 2021:15). Brå identified a 
number of areas in which society´s initiatives and measures can be strengthened in order to improve 
"the work to combat intimate partner violence among young people. For example, improve the "
"likelihood of detection through routine questions by health care, pupil and student health and child "
and youth psychiatry. Brå concludes that relevant societal actors lack suppor t for the target group 
"and presents several strategic measures to strengthen society's capacity. Among other things, Brå "
"proposes measures and efforts for LGBTQI people and vulnerable groups, and that the justice "
system's work against intimate partner viol ence among young couple -related can be strengthened.  
 
4. Strategic objective: Achieve balanced participation of women and men in political and public 
decision -making  
 
4.1 Legislative changes  
A special inquiry has been commissioned to consider whether there is a need for stronger protection 
"under criminal law for persons exercising their freedom of expression, in particular within "
journalism. The inquiry proposes a new special ground for more severe penalties for offences 
"committed against journalists. According to the proposed provision the courts, as aggravating "
"circumstances when assessing penalty value, in addition to what applies for each specific type of "
"offence, should give particular consideration to whether the offence was committed against a "
person on grounds of them or a family member having engaged in a news service or other 
journalism. The inquiry proposes that the provision should enter into force in July 2023.  
 
  
280 
  
4.5 Other pertinent developments  
The government has decided on several measures to combat threat and hatred against women 
online.  
 
Every two years The Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention produces the Politician’s Safety 
"Survey (PTU), which measures the extent and consequences of harassment, threats and violence "
experienced by elected representatives who are exposed in their capacity as elected 
"representatives. The PTU -data is sex -disaggregated, and respondents are asked to respond to "
"questions concerning self -reported victimisation during the previous year, including for example "
"whether there was any verbal, written or physic al attack of sexual nature in conjunction with the "
incidents.  
 
The Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority has been commissioned to launch an 
information campaign about online -hate in 2021 -2022. The campaign was targeted at persons who 
"are victims  of online -hate due to racism, gender -based hatred, sexism and similar forms of hostility. "
"The campaign also included to spread information about the website tysnainte.se, which contains "
information about online -hate and harassment.  
 
The Swedish Associatio n of Local Authorities and Regions (SALAR) has received funding in order to 
support and develop the systematic work of municipalities and county councils to combat and 
prevent hatred against elected representatives in 2022. The task includes to increase kn owledge 
about differences in exposure between women and men elected representatives in municipalities 
and regions and to contribute to the development of the municipalities' and regions' work to prevent 
"and deal with verbal, written or physical attacks of a sexual nature, which more often are directed "
towards women than men.  
 
"Linnaeus University is assignment to identify, develop and implement skills and capacity "
development efforts aimed at journalists and newsrooms to prevent and manage exposure to 
threat s and hatred. The assignment is proposed to focus on strengthening newsrooms' knowledge 
"of differences in the forms of threats and hatred directed at female and male journalists, and to "
especially strengthen newsrooms’ ability to deal with attacks and hara ssment of a sexual nature.  
 
"5. Strategic objective: Protect the rights of migrant, refugee and asylum -seeking women and girls  "
 
5.2 Policy changes  
No legislative or policy changes. The recent development/deterioration of the situation for women 
"in Afghanistan has caused the Swedish Migration Agency to issue a revised Legal Standpoint, which "
implies that all women asylum -seekers from Afghanistan are c onsidered to be in need of 
"international protection in Sweden, regardless of other circumstances.  "
 
6. Strategic objective: Achieve gender mainstreaming in all policies and measures  
 
6.1 Legislative changes   
Nothing new to report compared to 2021 . 
 
6.2 Policy changes  
Gender mainstreaming within the Government Offices of Sweden is carried out in accordance with 
a Government’s decision for gender mainstreaming within the Government Offices for the period 
2021 –2025. The decision establishes that gender mai nstreaming covers all work carried out within 
"the Government Offices but highlights four central processes in particular: the legislative process, "
"governance of public agencies, the budgetary process, EU matters and other international work. The "
281 
" Division f or Gender Equality does annual follow ups of the work with gender mainstreaming, as per "
annual reports from the 11 ministries.  
 
6.3 Institutional changes  
The programme period (2020 –2025) for gender mainstreaming in government agencies (GMGA) 
continues. The Government’s development programme for gender mainstreaming in government 
agencies encompasses 60 agencies and aims to strengthen gender mainstreaming. The agencies are 
"assigned to integrate a gender equality perspective in their activities, based on a  tailor -made action "
plan developed by the respective agency. The Swedish National Agency for Gender Equality supports 
the implementation of gender mainstreaming in the government agencies. Most of the agencies has 
"developed an infrastructure for future wor k for gender equality. Overall, the Government assesses "
that GMGA has been successful in contributing to the fulfilment of the six national goals for gender 
"equality, especially the goals of combating men’s violence against women, economic gender "
"equality,  and gender equal health.  "
 
Ongoing work also includes cooperation with the County Administrative Boards and the Swedish 
Association of Local Authorities and Regions (SALAR) to promote work on gender mainstreaming at 
regional and local level.  
 
The gender mainstreaming initiative in institutions of higher education continues. All Swedish 
"publicly funded institutions of higher education, plus Chalmers University of Technology and "
"Jönköping University, have had the assignment about Gender Mainstreaming in Aca demia (GMA) "
since 2016. The Swedish Gender Equality Agency continues to develop its structured and long -term 
"support. Results so far include development of different working methods, change in routines and "
"promoting ways of counteracting gender stereotypes  in study choices, promoting gender equal "
career paths and ensuring a more gender equal distribution of resources.  
 
6.4 Research and awareness -raising  
The Swedish National Agency for Gender Equality holds training courses on gender equality and the 
"2030  Agenda, gender responsive budgeting, gender and statistics, and on results -based "
management in the public sector. A web -based learning platform is being developed and some of 
the learning activities are carried out online.

2. Strategic objective: Prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence  
 
2.1 Legislative changes  
Türkiye's withdrawal from the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence 
against women and domestic violence did not have a negative effect on domestic legal regulations 
on combating violence.  
 
Law No. 6284 has been in force since 2012 and for its effective implementation the Ministry of 
"Justice and the Ministry of Interior works in co -ordination with all stakeholders, under the co -"
ordination of the Ministry of Family and Social Servic es.

Specialised units have been established within the scope of combating  violence in public 
prosecutors' offices and law enforcement units and capacity building studies have been carried out.

"With the Law No. 7406, which was adopted in the General Assembly of the Turkish Grand National "
Assembly on 12/05/2022 and entered int o force after being published in the Official Gazette dated 
"27/05/2022, significant changes were made in the Penal Code of Turkey No. 5237 and the Code of "

Crime of Persistent Tracking/ Stalking  
While persistent tracing acts were previo usly considered among other crimes regulated in the

Acceptance of Reason for Arrest  
 The crime of intentional injury committed against women has been counted as a reason for 
arrest as a result of the regulation made in the Code of Criminal Procedure No. 5271.  
 The fact that the crime of intentional injury is committed against the person who is unable 
to defend himself in terms of body or soul or with a monstrous feel ing has also taken its 
place as a reason for arrest within the scope of the Law No. 5271.  
 
"Contrary to the above -mentioned interpretation, the crime of intentional injury against women has "
been accepted as a clear reason for arrest.

"- Torment (art. 96),  "
"- Sexual abuse of children (art. 103),  "

"Before this last regulation, free legal aid was available to persons who were victims of sexual assault "
offences and to victims of crimes requiring a minimum sentence of more than five years in prison. 
"With the amendment, the scope of free legal aid has been expanded and the access of women who "
are victims of violence to justice has been strengthened.

"In the Article 96 of the Turkish Criminal Code, the crime of torture was regulated. According to the "
article;

many-ukraine-abuses-may-amount-war-crimes-2022-05-12/  accessed 19 May 2022.The armed conflict in Ukraine has been ongoing since 
2014 with little to no progress in achieving a political 
"solution.1 If anything, the situation on the ground has "
continued to worsen since the Russian Federation’s 
full-fledged invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 
"2022, causing the destruction of infrastructure, mass "
"displacement, and significant harm to civilians and "
"other protected persons.2 In early April 2022, the "
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
"(OHCHR) estimated that 15,600 to 16,000 have been "
"killed and 39,000 to 41,000 people injured.3 As of "
"May 2022, 7.7 million persons are estimated to have "
"been internally displaced,4 more than 4.5 million "
"refugees registered across Europe, and nearly 3 "
million refugees registered for temporary protection 
schemes in Europe.5 As the armed conflict continues 
"to unfold, reports of conflict-related sexual violence "
(CRSV) perpetrated by Russian soldiers are growing.6 
Accurate estimates are unavailable due to a myriad 
"of challenges, including ongoing hostilities and "
the trauma experienced by victims which inhibits 
"disclosure. Nevertheless, available information "
indicates that CRSV is happening in a gruesome 
"manner, and that the reported incidents are feared to "
be the tip of the iceberg.
The commission of CRSV in Ukraine is not new. It was 
perpetrated by all parties to the conflict since 2014 
(yet on a lower scale by Ukrainian forces) in detention 
"facilities, checkpoints across the contact line, and "
within communities with increased military presence.7 
Areas temporarily controlled by Russian forces in 2022 
reported incidents of rape and other forms of sexual violence which appear to have taken place in civilians’ 
homes as well as in places used by civilians as shelters.8 
It will however take time to investigate and understand 
the full scope and patterns of CRSV committed since 
the start of the invasion.
This Study’s initial focus was on assessing the status 
of and opportunities for reparations for CRSV 
survivors in Ukraine in the context prior to the 2022 
"Russian full-fledged invasion of Ukraine, including "
through engagement with CRSV survivors from the 
"conflict since 2014, but prior to 2022. However, given "
"the current situation, the Study now explores how "
reparations can still be established in light of the new 
"circumstances, and the increasing urgency to do so."
"The Study finds that CRSV is ongoing in Ukraine, "
"with devastating effects on individuals, families, and "
society. Survivors of CRSV committed since 2014 were 
"interviewed as part of this Study, indicating extreme "
"unmet medical, psychological, and economic needs. "
Not all participating survivors were familiar with the 
"right to reparation, yet they indicated that it should be "
"an entitlement, and that for them, it is part of justice. "
Consulted survivors prioritised individual forms of 
"redress, such as compensation and rehabilitation, "
but also demanded collective symbolic reparations 
such as a public acknowledgment of the harms 
"CRSV survivors have suffered, and being granted "
victim status. Displaced survivors emphasised the 
"urgent need for housing assistance, document "
"recovery, and support in securing employment. At "
"the time of consulting survivors, prior to the 2022 "
7
"Russian invasion, survivors expressed their fear of the "
repetition of crimes and demanded guarantees of 
"non-recurrence. Importantly, CRSV survivors agreed "
that in order to effectively redress the harms they have 
"experienced, the process for developing reparation "
programmes should ensure their meaningful and 
effective participation. 
There has been no comprehensive state policy 
in Ukraine for remedy and reparation for the 
benefit of victims and survivors affected by the 
"conflict since 2014, including for CRSV survivors.9 "
As the number of victims and survivors continues 
"to grow, laying the ground for an adequate and "
comprehensive reparations programme is ever 
more urgent. While faced with challenges to the 
"establishment of reparation programmes, not least "
of which is the ongoing conflict and commission 
"of CRSV, opportunities also exist. Current domestic "
"and international efforts, including in the areas "
"of accountability, humanitarian assistance, and "
"sanctions regimes, all represent significant avenues "
to advance the establishment and financing of 
reparation programmes.
The heightened attention by the international 
community to the situation in Ukraine and the 
expressed political support to Ukraine and the 
Ukrainian people must be accompanied by action 
to support all necessary steps to advance the rights 
"of victims and survivors, including to comprehensive "
and adequate reparation. Urgent interim reparations 
are also needed to address the urgent needs of CRSV 
victims and survivors and prevent irreparable harm. 
"In this respect, support, technical assistance, and "
funding are needed from the international community 
to advance President Zelenskyy’s proposal for the 
"establishment of a compensation fund, which could "
lead to advancing compensation and other forms of 
"reparations. By providing urgent interim reparations, "
and commencing the work for the establishment of a 
"comprehensive reparation programme without delay, "
Ukraine can set an example in ensuring that harm 
suffered by victims and survivors is redressed in a 
"timely manner, and when survivors need it the most."

Documents/Countries/UA/31stReportUkraine-en.pdf  accessed 8 April 2022.Key recommendations for 
advancing victims’ right to 
reparation in Ukraine include
• To the President of Ukraine:  Publicly 
acknowledge the gravity of crimes and violations 
suffered by CRSV victims and survivors and the 
"distinct harm they suffer, indicating that such "
violations and crimes are wrongful acts that will 
not be tolerated and will be addressed. Pass a 
presidential decree to set up a comprehensive as 
"well an urgent interim reparation programmes, a "
reparations fund and a registry for victims;
• To the Ukrainian Government:  Ensure that 
victims’ right to a remedy and reparations is 
embedded in the government’s overall legal and 
policy framework put in place to respond to the 
"conflict, including in accountability frameworks;"
• To the Ukrainian Parliament:  Draft and 
approve legislation for the acknowledgment of 
"CRSV and the provision of reparations to victims, "
through the establishment of a comprehensive 
administrative reparations programme comprising 
various forms of reparations;
• To Ukraine’s Office of the Prosecutor General:  
Take steps to ensure that CRSV investigations 
and prosecutions contribute to administrative 
reparation programmes and other transitional justice 
"mechanisms in the future, for example by including "
key documentation of harm suffered by CRSV 
survivors and registering victims;
• To the international community: Take 
concrete action to further survivors’ access to a 
remedy and reparations including through the 
provision of technical assistance to the Ukrainian 
Government and by exploring means to finance 
"reparations, for example through the repurposing "
of sanctioned assets.EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

I. BACKGROUND AND METHODOLOGY
"10 GSF, 'Global Reparations Study' www.globalsurvivorsfund.org/guide  accessed 29 May 2022.1.  About the project, project partners, "
"authors, and acknowledgments"
1.1. About the project
"The Global Survivors Fund (GSF), in collaboration "
"with Blue Bird, the Eastern-Ukrainian Center for Civic "
"Initiatives (EUCCI), and Truth Hounds have conducted "
a study to identify the reparations’ needs of CRSV 
"survivors in Ukraine, as well as the opportunities for "
delivering reparations to survivors through judicial 
and administrative processes. This study presents 
and analyses survivors’ perceptions and expectations 
"for reparations and offers practical, concrete, and "
context specific recommendations to policy makers 
and other relevant actors at national and global levels 
to inform the design and delivery of survivor-centred 
"reparations in Ukraine. As an objective in itself, the "
Ukraine Reparations Study process further aimed 
to increase the understanding and awareness of 
survivors’ rights to reparations and to create further 
momentum for the delivery of meaningful survivor-
centred reparations to CRSV victims in Ukraine. 
The Ukraine Reparations Study is part of a global 
study on reparations (the Global Reparations Study) 
"launched by GSF in 2020, which focusses on the "
status of and opportunities for reparations for CRSV 
in over 25 countries.10 The Global Reparations Study 
is a multi-actor effort led by GSF in collaboration 
"with over 40 national and international partners, "
including survivors’ networks and groups. It seeks 
to make recommendations for further action based 
on survivors’ needs and aspirations and to identify 
potential support available among key actors and 
concrete action to enhance access to reparations for 
CRSV survivors around the world.1.2. About the project partners 
 
GSF was launched in October 2019 by Dr Denis 
"Mukwege and Ms Nadia Murad, the 2018 Nobel "
Peace Prize laureates. Its mission is to enhance 
access to reparations for survivors of conflict-related 
"sexual violence around the globe, thus seeking to "
fill a gap long identified by survivors. GSF acts to 
provide interim reparative measures in situations 
where states or other parties are unable or unwilling 
to meet their responsibilities. GSF advocates 
"also for duty bearers, as well as the international "
"community, to develop reparations programmes, and "
provides expertise and technical support to guide 
states and civil society in the design of reparations 
programmes. GSF’s survivor-centric approach is the

2. Methodology
2.1. Aim of the Ukraine Reparations Study
The Study aimed to identify the remedies available 
"in Ukraine for accessing reparations for CRSV, both "
"judicial and non-judicial, and the challenges that "
"survivors face to access reparations, as well as the "
opportunities that exist to ensure that survivors 
"receive prompt, adequate, and effective reparation.2.2.  Specific objectives of the "
Ukraine Reparations Study
"1. Provide an overview, to the extent possible, of the "
"scope and extent of CRSV committed since 2014, "
taking into account reports of CRSV committed 
since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine 
from 24 February 2022. 
2. Identify and assess legal and administrative 
remedies for awarding reparations to survivors 
of CRSV in place prior to the full-fledged Russian 
invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. 
Consider the new context’s impact on access to 
remedies and reparations including exploring 
"opportunities for, as well as challenges to access "
to reparations.
"3. Provide insights into survivors’ perspectives, "
"needs, and expectations in relation to reparation "
through engagement with survivors of CRSV 
"committed since 2014, but prior to 2022."
4. Provide contextual recommendations for 
ensuring that reparations and interim reparative 
measures are provided to all survivors of CRSV 
in Ukraine.
2.3. Study methodology
The Ukraine Reparations Study was carried out 
"using mixed research methods, both quantitative "
and qualitative. Semi-structured interviews and 
"two focus group discussions were conducted, and "
survivor’s demographic profiles were also gathered 
and analysed. Extensive desk research of primary and 
secondary data was also conducted.

11 For further information see: SEMA Global Network of Victims and Survivors to End Wartime Sexual Violence www.semanetwork.org/the-sema-global-
"network/  accessed 9 June 2022.The Study was carried out in various stages. First, desk-"
"based review of reports, studies, and other materials "
from human rights organisations and international 
bodies was conducted to examine available 
information on CRSV in Ukraine committed between 
"2014 and 2021, its impact, and available remedies. The "
Ukraine Reparations Study Lead conducted a scoping 
"mission to Kyiv, Ukraine in November 2020, during "
which she met with representatives of Ukrainian civil 
"society organisations, international organisations, "
"and SEMA Ukraine, part of the Global Network "
of Victims and Survivors to End Wartime Sexual 
Violence. The SEMA network represents survivors of 
conflict-related sexual violence of different countries 
and seeks “to draw attention to the use of sexual 
"violence as a weapon of war, and call for the changes "
needed to end the violence and achieve justice.”11 
GSF discussed the Study’s objectives with the SEMA 
"network members, and considered how, from their "
"perspective, it should be carried out in a trauma-"
sensitive manner.A total of 27 survivors participated in the Ukraine 
Reparations Study. 20 out of the 27 survivors 
participated in semi-structured interviews (SSI) 
administered by researchers from the Ukraine 
"Reparations Study partners, which were later "
coded and analysed. These survivors responded 
"to a standardised questionnaire developed by GSF, "
which was adapted to the Ukrainian context through 
consultation with the Study partners. The seven other 
"survivors, who were members of the SEMA Network "
"in Ukraine, participated in a one-day unrecorded "
"focus-group discussion in July 2021, facilitated by "
"EUCCI and GSF, which followed selected parts of the "
standardised questionnaire and informed in particular 
the recommendations of this Study. 
The research questions sought to understand 
survivors’ experiences of the harms suffered as a 
result of CRSV and to assess their understanding of 
and expectations for reparations. The interviews were 
conducted following a ‘Do No Harm’ approach and I. BACKGROUND AND METHODOLOGY

"in line with key principles set out in the Murad Code,12 "
a global code of conduct distilling existing minimum 
standards to ensure information from survivors of 
"conflict-related sexual violence is collected in a safe, "
"effective, and ethical way. They also considered "
gender and cultural contexts to minimise additional 
"harm or risk to respondents, informed consent "
"requirements, and survivor-sensitive approaches to "
data collection.
The research was conducted in a trauma-informed 
manner and sought to have a reparative effect. 
All survivors were offered the opportunity to have 
a psychologist present while the interviews were 
conducted. The psychologists offered support to 
survivors and advised facilitators on how to address 
potential re-traumatisation. The focus group 
discussion facilitators and data collectors also took 
steps to protect the privacy and confidentiality of 
"respondents and discussion participants, for example "
"through anonymisation or use of pseudonyms, and "
holding focus groups discussions at venues that were 
safe and offered privacy. Additional activities were 
organised in the focus group discussions to allow 
survivors to connect and express solidarity.
The responses from interviews were uploaded to 
a secure server. They were coded and subjected 
"to theme recurrence and word frequency analysis, "
"using NVivo, a qualitative data analysis software, "
"to identify the most relevant impacts of CRSV, "
"concerns, perceptions, needs, risks, and demands in "
"terms of reparations from survivors, as well assessing "
their agency. 
Quantitative data from the survivor’s demographic 
profiles was also gathered and entered into the online 
surveying software KoBo Toolbox. This was then used 
to understand the sample of survivors participating in 
"the Study, to produce graphs, and to analyse patterns "
"between survivors’ profiles and their perceptions, "
"needs, and expectations. RStudio software was used "
to create charts based on the demographic data. 
"Finally, GSF researchers combed through transcripts "
and software-produced data to inform the drafting 
"of the Study’s sections, and in particular, Section IV "
"on Survivors’ Perceptions, Needs, Priorities, and Risks."
12 Global Code of Conduct for Gathering and using information about systematic and conflict-related sexual violence (Murad Code) (13 April 2022)  
www.muradcode.com/murad-code  accessed 10 June 2022.The Study’s recommendations emerged from both 
GSF research and from survivors. Survivors proposed 
recommendations during the semi-structured 
interviews and in a second focus group discussion 
"that took place in September 2021, where GSF "
researchers and partners presented preliminary 
findings of the research to survivors who previously 
participated in semi-structured interviews for this 
Study.  The information gathered from the first 
focus group discussion was also used to inform the 
recommendations of this Study.
2.4. Study limitations
The findings of this Study are based on views and 
experiences of CRSV survivors victimised from 2014 
"onwards but prior to 2022. While the Study partners, "
"GSF, Blue Bird, EUCCI, and Truth Hounds, tried to "
"consult a diverse sample of survivors, there was no "
participation from survivors of CRSV that took place 
"in Crimea, due to access challenges and limitations "
in documenting such incidents. The particular needs 
of these survivor groups may therefore not be fully 
reflected in the following sections.
Ukraine was in its seventh year of political stalemate 
with the Russian Federation (Russia) when this Study 
"was launched, in 2020. When GSF was finalising "
"the Ukraine Study, Russia launched its full-fledged "
"invasion of Ukraine, on 24 February 2022. Reflection "
in greater detail on the scale and scope of sexual 
violence committed in the context of the 2022 
"invasion has not been possible, although there are "
many reliable reports of sexual violence.
Most of the recommendations of this Study come 
from survivors who were interviewed and took part in 
"a focus group discussion in September 2021, prior to "
"the invasion, and mostly address how the Ukrainian "
Government should redress those subjected to 
violence from 2014. While a number of the identified 
recommendations are now challenged by the new 
"surge of hostilities, therefore requiring reflection in "
"light of these changes, many other recommendations "
"have become even more pertinent, particularly with "
the growing number of CRSV survivors. Due to 
13
"ongoing hostilities and heightened security threats, it "
was not possible for GSF to consult survivors on those 
"needed changes, which instead emerged from GSF "
researchers and staff and the Study partners.
The Study captures the potential ways forward to 
"ensure reparation for CRSV survivors in Ukraine, "
particularly in light of the Ukrainian Government’s 
readiness to redress victims. While the Russian 
Federation and the armed groups in eastern Ukraine 
"also have a legal obligation to provide reparations to survivors, such obligations have not been fully "
"explored in the present Study. Additionally, the current "
disregard for obligations under international law and 
customary international law by the Russian Federation 
"and by armed groups in eastern Ukraine, coupled "
with the denial of the commission of CRSV and other 
crimes and attitudes towards victims and affected 
"populations more generally, provide clear indications "
that these parties to the conflict are unlikely to take 
voluntary steps to fulfil the victims’ right to a remedy 
and reparations anytime soon.I. BACKGROUND AND METHODOLOGY

"sexual violence continues to be a common, "
regrettable feature of armed conflicts and has 
devastating consequences for survivors across the 
world.13 Since the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine 
"broke out in early 2014 and in occupied Crimea, sexual "
violence has been committed by all parties to the 
"conflict, albeit on a lower scale by Ukrainian forces.14 "
"Since then, sexual violence has been perpetrated in "
"the context of detention, at checkpoints, and in other "
"settings to target civilians and protected persons, "
"inflict pain on communities, and disrupt the social "
fabric. Since Russia’s full-fledged invasion of Ukraine 
"on 24 February 2022, reports of CRSV committed by "
"Russian soldiers against civilians have been spiking, "
and yet is still likely to be underreported.15
"CRSV has grave physical, psychological, and "
"socioeconomic impacts for survivors, their families, and "
"their communities, yet since 2014 there has been limited "
progress towards redressing or mitigating those harms in 
Ukraine. While there have been some advances towards 
a better understanding of CRSV (in distinguishing it 
"from domestic violence and gender-based violence, as "
"an issue affecting only women, or limited only to rape), "
reparations for CRSV survivors remain elusive. As a 
"direct consequence of this failure to provide reparations, "
survivors continue to endure the consequences of the 
harms suffered without redress. 
"This Study reviews what is known about the scale, "
"scope, and nature of CRSV in Ukraine since 2014, "
including the limited information available about 
CRSV committed since the Russian invasion of Ukraine 
in 2022. Through direct engagement with survivors 
"of CRSV committed since 2014 but before 2022, the "
Study provides insights into the impacts of CRSV 
"on these survivors, their needs and expectations in relation to accessing reparations, and how these "
can be met. While the views of survivors of CRSV 
"committed in 2022 are not reflected in this Study, "
the gathered insights may nonetheless be relevant 
and informative to address the needs of all survivors. 
The Study then provides an overview of Ukraine’s 
legislative and policy frameworks relevant to CRSV 
and the obstacles and opportunities survivors face to 
secure reparation. It also makes recommendations on 
the way forward. 
This Study is divided in eight sections. Section I 
presents the background and methodology of the 
"research and introduced partners. Section II, this "
"roadmap, presents this report’s remaining sections. "
"Section III provides and overview of the context, "
"nature, and scope of CRSV perpetrated in Ukraine, "
"including forms and patterns of CRSV, looking in "
particular at the profile of survivors. Section IV 
presents several important themes that emerged 
"from the data collected from survivors, examining "
"in particular the impacts CRSV has had on survivors, "
"their families, and their societies. It also presents "
"survivors’ perceptions, needs and priorities for "
"reparations, as well as associated challenges in "
making such priorities a reality. Section V analyses 
normative frameworks and available avenues for 
reparations under international and domestic law 
that are relevant to reparations in Ukraine. Section 
"VI explores both opportunities for, and possible "
challenges to effective reparations. Section VII 
on Recommendations details our suggestions on 
advancing reparations for CRSV survivors. Section VIII 
concludes this report by providing concrete steps for 
"the way forward. Finally, Annex I provides an overview "

The armed conflict in the Donbas region of eastern 
Ukraine erupted in early 2014. It endured eight 
"years of political stalemate until 24 February 2022, "
when Russia invaded Ukraine leading to a significant 
escalation of the hostilities in the East and extending 
to other regions of Ukraine. 
"Donbas includes the Luhansk oblasts, currently "
partially under the control of the self-proclaimed 
"Luhansk People’s ‘Republic’ (LPR), and the Donetsk "
"oblasts, partially under the control of the self-"
proclaimed Donetsk People’s ‘Republic’ (DPR). Both 
the ‘LPR’ and ‘DPR’ have been Russian-backed 
"separatist groups since 2014, and on 21 February "
"2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed decrees "
recognising them as independent states.16
Between the 14th of April 2014 and the 31st of 
"December 2021, the OHCHR estimated that between "
"14,200 to 14,400 persons were killed (of which 3,404 "
"were civilians), 37,000 to 39,000 persons injured,17 "
and roughly 1.5 million persons had been displaced.18 
"Since the 2022 Russian invasion, casualties have steadily increased with the OHCHR reporting "
"977 persons killed, 1,594 persons injured,19 and "
about 4 million refugees in just the first month of  
the invasion.20
"In late 2013, protests began in Kyiv following then-"
President Viktor Yanukoyych’s abandonment of 
the Association Agreement between the European 
"Union and Ukraine on 21 November 2013,21 in favour "
of closer economic and political ties with Russia.22 
"These protests, known as the Revolution of Dignity, "
"continued into 2014 and grew rapidly, particularly in "
Kyiv at the central Independence Square (Euromaidan). 
"As protests grew, so did police brutality as they "
attempted to clear and suppress the protesters.23 
"In response, the Ukrainian legislative body, Verkhovna "
"Rada, passed anti-protest legislation in January 2014 "
which exacerbated protestors’ outrage.24 During 
"these protests, about 104 protestors were killed and "
are now honoured as the “Heavenly Hundred.”25 
"On 22 February 2014, the Rada voted to remove "
President Yanukovych from office on the basis that 
he could no longer execute his duties as President 
as he had left Ukraine and escaped to Russia.26 
Oleksandr Turchynov was put in place as the new 
UKRAINE18
"interim president, and a new prime minister, Arseniy "
"Yatsenyuk, assumed office until the special election in "
May 2014.27
"Days after Yanukovych was removed, armed "
"individuals seized government buildings in Simferopol, "
the capital of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea.28 
As reported by OHCHR: “ Ukrainian Authorities alleged 
that the armed men were Russian armed forces 
and/or allied local paramilitary groups. The Russian 
Government insisted that the forces did not include 
"Russian troops, but only local self-defence groups”.29 "
"Later, however, President Putin admitted that he "
“gave orders to the Defence Ministry to deploy special 
"forces of the Main Intelligence Directorate, along with "
marines and commandos”30 to facilitate the takeover 
"of the Peninsula. A referendum, widely regarded "
"to be fraudulent, was held in Crimea to join the "
Russian Federation and passed on 16 March 2014.31 
Russia’s ongoing control over the Peninsula remains 
in violation of international law32 and is recognised  
as occupation.33
The human rights situation in eastern Ukraine continued 
to deteriorate as pro-Russia armed groups gained 
partial control of buildings and territory in Luhansk and

"Chechnya, and other North Caucasus citizens.35 Notably, "
the OHCHR’s Human Rights Monitoring Mission in 
Ukraine (HRMMU) “ observed armed men on trucks and 
armoured vehicles moving around downtown Donetsk 
"in daylight.”36 On 14 April 2014, the interim Ukrainian "
president Oleksander Turchynov declared an “anti-
terrorist operation” in the territory of eastern Ukraine.37 
"A month later, in May 2014, separatists in Luhansk and "
Donetsk also declared independence from Ukraine after 
holding referendums that have been widely viewed as 
fraudulent and illegal.38 The separatists’ referendums 
exacerbated the levels of violence in the region as the 
Ukrainian military struggled to regain control.39
Numerous agreements aimed at finding a solution 
"to the conflict have since been signed, such as "
the Minsk I and Minsk II agreements in 2014 and 
2015 respectively.40 The first Minsk Agreement  
(Protocol) was signed the 5th of September 2014 by 
"representatives of Ukraine, the Russian Federation, "
"representatives of the ‘DPR’ and the ‘LPR’, and the "
Organisation of Security and Cooperation in Europe 
"(OSCE) for, inter alia , an immediate ceasefire and "
the halting of the conflict in Eastern Ukraine.41 The 
19
"Minsk Protocol included many positive provisions, "
such as the release of hostages and unlawfully 
"detained persons,42 but also contained problematic "
"provisions, such as prohibiting prosecutions "
"of persons for conflict-related events, which is "
interpreted differently by the various parties to the 
conflict in relation to the prosecutions of conflict-
related crimes.43 With constant violations of the 
"ceasefire by all parties to the conflict, particularly "
"close to the contact line,44 a new ceasefire agreement "
was agreed upon on 15 February 2015 and is known 
as the “Minsk II agreement”.45 This agreement 
also includes a package of measures for military 
"demobilization, granting access for humanitarian aid "
"workers, and the implementation of the ceasefire.46 "
Despite lack of progress in implementing the Minsk 
"agreements, they were still considered the basis for "
the resolution of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.47 
"However, the Minsk agreements were publicly ended "
by Russian President Vladimir Putin a few days prior to 
"Russia’s full-fledged invasion of Ukraine in 2022, when "
he recognised the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of 
Ukraine as independent.48

documents/eur50/3255/2020/en/  accessed 6 May 2022.Study focuses on sexual violence with a direct nexus 
"to conflict, understanding attitudes to gender-"
"based and sexual violence in general, including the "
"stigmatisation, rejection, and victim-blaming towards "
"survivors, puts into context CRSV survivors’ reluctance "
"to report or disclose the details of their victimisation, "
which in turn compounds challenges faced to access 
justice and essential services.
"In an OSCE survey from 2019, 24% of women agreed "
that “ Violence against women is often provoked by the 
victim ”.60 In a United Nations Populations Fund (UNFPA) 
"survey from 2018, 50% of men agreed that “ If a woman "
"was affected by alcohol or drugs, she is guilty in that "
situation to some extent .”61 These harmful stereotypes 
which translate to victim-blaming and isolation may 
result in survivors’ feelings of shame or guilt and 
discourage them from reporting gender-based and 
sexual violence. They also demonstrate a societal 
readiness to reject and stigmatise survivors and thereby 
impede their access to justice and reparation.
Gender insensitivity and prejudice is also present 
"within public institutions, including law enforcement "
and the judiciary.62 This leads to police reluctance to 
"take up complaints or, at times, miscategorising sexual "
violence as “disorderly conduct” or “bodily harm”.63 
This represents one of the limitations to the reporting 
of sexual violence in Ukraine.
It should be noted that recent surveys have pointed 
to changing perspectives on gender roles and social 
stigmas regarding sexual violence among Ukrainian 
"youth, regardless of gender. Young women are also less "
"likely to blame victims for sexual violence.64 That said, it "
is evident that significant efforts are needed to mitigate 
stigmatisation and other harmful attitudes towards 
"survivors of gender-based violence, including CRSV, and "
to ensure their access to justice and essential services.

"states, not including Ukraine and Russia: 1 August 2014."
"66 OSCE, ‘OSCE-led Survey on Violence Against Women: Ukraine’ (n58) 53-54."
67 Ibid.2.2.  Barriers to reporting conflict-
related sexual violence
"Within Ukraine, many survivors do not report CRSV "
and other forms of gender-based violence due to a 
"wide variety of legal, psycho-social, and economic "
"barriers present in Ukraine, some of which existed "
prior to the start of the conflict in 2014. An OSCE 
"survey implemented in 2018 looking into violence against women in conflict and non-conflict settings, "
"including sexual violence, found that the top three "
reasons Ukrainian survivors did not report CRSV 
"were: first, that survivors were dealing with the "
"trauma on their own or with someone else; second, "
that they did not want anyone else to know of 
"the incident;66 and third, that they did not believe "
the violation or crimes they suffered were serious 
enough to report.67
UKRAINE22
Psycho-social barriers to reporting CRSV are extensive. 
"In the mentioned OSCE survey, fear and anger "
following physical or sexual violence were the two 
most common emotions female survivors reported.68 
Survivors felt angry that they were attacked and 
"fearful of others finding out, of being stigmatised, and "
of retaliation.69 Even though four out of five survivors 
of physical violence experienced long-term mental 
health disorders70 and 40-55% experienced serious 
"physical harm, the overwhelming majority still did not "
report the incidents.71 A lack of safe shelters and social 
or healthcare services available may also contribute to 
survivors not reporting.72 
A final key deterrent to reporting was and is the ever-
present armed conflict. In regions with high levels of 
"hostilities, people are often reluctant to talk for fear "
of reprisal.73 Armed groups have frequently stopped 
humanitarian services from reaching survivors in 
"conflict areas, denying survivors the opportunity to "
report or seek vital social and healthcare support.74 
There are even fewer safe shelters for LGBTQI+ 
"persons75 and, as of 2020, none for male survivors of "
sexual violence.76
"Since the 2022 full-fledged Russian invasion, armed "
combat and Russian shelling have forced citizens to 
"hide in their homes, basements, metro stations, and "
bomb shelters for days and sometimes weeks on 
end.77 Millions have fled their homes as refugees and 
"IDPs, a significant portion of whom are women and "
"girls, leaving behind not only their homes but often "

with a delay. 
"2.3.  Scale, scope, forms, and "
patterns of crime
Existing documentation of CRSV committed 
in Ukraine between 2014-2021 shows that it 
predominantly occurred in the contexts of detention 
"or other deprivations of liberty, at checkpoints, and in "
regions with a heightened military presence.79 
"For reasons described above, CRSV was reported with "
delays. Most incidents of CRSV occurred in 2014 and 
"2015,80 yet most comprehensive reports capturing "
CRSV came out in 2017 and later.81 Documentation 
was initially difficult as human rights and international 
organisations had extremely limited access to areas 
controlled by pro-Russia armed groups and to 
"Crimea, and because survivors faced numerous "
"barriers to report their attacks, as described in the "
previous section.82 
OHCHR reported that sexual violence was committed 
by all parties to the conflict between 14 March 2014 
"and 31 January 2017, in varying levels,83 although "
Ukraine’s civil society reported that CRSV incidents 
by government actors occurred on a lower scale.84 
"That said, there was no evidence of CRSV being "
used in that time period for tactical reasons by the 
23
"government forces, armed groups in conflict-affected "
"eastern Ukraine, or by Russia in Crimea.85 "
"In the context of the ongoing invasion, significant reports "
by victims and witnesses of CRSV committed by Russian 
soldiers are surfacing. The emerging reports indicate that 
sexual violence is being committed where there is Russian 
military presence in civilian areas.86 Additional settings 
for CRSV in 2022 might exist but would need time to be 
comprehensively documented and investigated. 
While Ukraine’s Prosecutor General and various 
other actors are carrying out investigations into

2.3.1. SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN DETENTION FACILITIES 
Persons deprived of their liberty are particularly 
vulnerable to CRSV and other forms of violence due 
to unequal power dynamics between the detainee 
and those in control of detention facilities. Places 
of detention are environments that are inherently 
coercive and in which genuine consent to sexual acts 
is essentially impossible.88

"Illegal detention facility in temporarily occupied territory in Donetsk Oblast, "
"eastern Ukraine, in which allegations of CRSV were reported to EUCCI. "

UKRAINE24
"According to OHCHR, Ukraine, from 14 April 2014 "
"to 30 April 2021, the total number of detentions in "
the context of the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine 
"is estimated at between 7,900 and 8,700, with "
"government forces responsible for 3,600-4,000 "
"detentions, and armed groups and other actors in "
territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’ 
"responsible for 4,300-4,700 detentions.89 Men "
comprised 85% of detainees. 90 The detention of 
"children was rare, estimated to be in the dozens, and "
"short-term, with most occurring at the beginning of "
the conflict.91
Of the individuals detained in Ukrainian Government 
"detention centres, the majority were brought in "
due to suspicion of support for or membership 
in armed groups.92 OHCHR found that 60% of  
these detentions were arbitrary.93 These detainees 
"were often subjected to acts of sexual violence, in "
"conjunction with torture and other ill-treatment, to "
"punish, humiliate, and/or to extract confessions.94 "
Threats were also directed at detainees’ female family 
"members. At times, the perpetrators even detained "
"female family members for a short time, to exert "
"pressure on the male detainees.95 In most cases, such "
threats were used to force the victim to “confess” or 
"otherwise cooperate with the investigators, security, "
"or military actors.96 As documented by OHCHR, “ rape, "
"threats of rape, beatings and electrocution of genitals "
"were often used as an interrogation technique”, and in "
many cases amounted to torture.97

Conflict-related sexual violence has also been

checkpoints are frequently crossed as Ukrainian 
citizens residing in the temporarily Non-government

"very few checkpoints were open, leading to long "

UKRAINE30
"In September 2016, a woman was trying to cross "
the contact line in Donetsk from a NGCA to a 
government-controlled area (GCA) but was told 
there was a problem with her permit. A Ukrainian 
officer told her that he had noticed her and had 
intentionally made a mistake with her permit 
renewal and subsequently demanded that she 
go with him to a hotel room or otherwise be 
kidnapped and buried alive. The perpetrator made 
"her sit on his lap and touched her body, as she "
cried and begged him to stop. He agreed to let 
her go on the condition that she come back to 
"the checkpoint, threatening physical violence and "
blackmail. OHCHR assisted the survivor in filing a 
complaint with the police.129
The increased military and armed group presence in 
residential communities since 2014 has also resulted in 
incidents of sexual violence against local civilians. The 
perpetrators tend to be members of the Ukrainian 
"military130 and armed groups.131 For example, in "
"Marinka, in October 2016, a woman was alone in her "
house in the Government-Controlled Areas (GCA) 
when drunk members of the Ukrainian armed forces 
broke into her house and started touching her and 
"trying to pull her skirt down. When she struggled, "
one of the perpetrators hit her in the face with a metal 
"bowl. She managed to escape and call her landlord, "
who called the police and the commander of the 
"military unit. Although a case was filed, the police told "
"the survivor it was her fault, and the case was closed "
due to a lack of evidence.132
"In the temporarily NGCA, members of the armed "
groups prevented free movement in some residential 
areas and kept women “for entertainment”.133

"against women134 and perceived LGBTQI+ people, "
who are particularly vulnerable in the NGCA because 
persecution and violence against LGBTQI+ people 
are sanctioned by the armed groups’ policies.135 
"In Donetsk, in June 2014, armed groups attacked "
an LGBTQI+ nightclub. They forced the patrons 
outside and made them form a line. The armed 
groups then demanded that the patrons kiss while 
"being recorded, or else they would be shot.136"
Shortly after the start of the Russian Invasion of 
"Ukraine in 2022, reports of rape and other forms "
of sexual violence against women and children by 
"Russian soldiers began to surface, particularly in "
residential areas with significant Russian military 
"presence.137 In April 2022, Kateryna Cherepakha, "
"the President of La Strada-Ukraine, which operates "
a national helpline for the prevention of domestic 
"violence and human trafficking, stated that: "
"“ Since early March, La Strada alone has received "
calls relating to the rape of 10 women and 3 
girls by Russian soldiers. The youngest of the 
girls is only 12-years old. Some of these rapes 
"have taken place in front of family members, in "
"one case a child, in another the husband of the "
survivor who was then killed.”138 
Accurate estimates of CRSV incidents committed in 
the context of the invasion are unavailable due to a 
"myriad of challenges, including ongoing hostilities "
and the trauma experienced by victims which inhibits 
"disclosure. Nevertheless, available information "
indicates that CRSV is happening in a particularly 
31
gruesome manner and is likely to be widespread. As 
"of 3 June 2022, OHCHR’s human rights monitoring "
team has received reports of 124 alleged CRSV acts 
in Ukraine.139 OHCHR reported that the majority of 
"victims are women and girls, while noting that men "
and boys were also victimised.140 Reported incidents 
"of CRSV acts include rape, gang rape, and other "
"forms of sexual violence, often in the presence of "
family members who were made to watch.141 In some 
"incidents, family members were killed during the "
incident in which CRSV was perpetrated.142
The settings for CRSV committed by Russian soldiers 
during the invasion include places that are used as 
"shelters by civilians, such as schools and basements, "
but also civilians’ homes in areas that Russian forces 
"temporarily occupied, and where civilians were "
"terrorised with a myriad of crimes, including sexual "
violence.143 As Russian troops withdrew from territories 
"they previously occupied, harrowing details of CRSV "
incidents have been revealed. Bucha is one gruesome 
"example, where the body of a killed Ukrainian woman "
"was found after the retreat of Russian troops, covered "
"with nothing but a fur coat, next to condom wrappers "
and a used condom.144
"While reports of CRSV mount, and as the conflict "
"rages on, information currently available on CRSV is "
unlikely to be reflective of its true scale and scope.

LINKED TO THE CONFLICT
"While not part of this Study’s focus, indirect links "
have also been made between the conflict since 2014 
"and sex work, sex trafficking, and sexual domestic "
violence. Many women who live in the temporarily 
NGCA were forced to resort to sex work to support 
"their families, and have experienced sexual violence "
"while engaging in prostitution with the military, "
"law enforcement personnel, and armed groups.145 "
Women also experience barriers to reporting this 
violence due to the criminalisation and stigmatisation 
of sex work.146 
Human trafficking increased after 2014 as a result 
"of economic hardship due to the conflict, and was "
further compounded by displacement and the 
weakening of social cohesion.147 While trafficking 
"has affected both men and women, women make "
up the majority of registered sexual exploitation 
victims.148 Despite the prevalence of sex trafficking in 
"Ukraine, there is a lack of centralised data, and a lack "
of capacity of state agencies.149 Displaced children 
or children separated from their parents have also 
been vulnerable to trafficking in Ukraine.150 Any 
investigation into the rise in human trafficking was 
hampered by the poor relationship between Ukraine 
and the Russian Federation.151III. CONFLICT-RELATED SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN UKRAINE

"On 16 March 2022, the United Nations (UN) Special "

"and children, the UN Special Rapporteur on violence "
"against women, its causes and consequences, and the "
UN Under-Secretary-General and Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict 
issued a statement expressing “ serious concerns at the 
"heightened risks of sexual violence, especially trafficking "
"in persons, impacting significantly women and children "
fleeing the conflict in Ukraine and forcibly displaced”.152 
2.3.4. PROFILE AND MAPPING OF VICTIMS
Victims of the 2014 conflict include people of all genders 
and ages. Survivors of CRSV in Ukrainian government-
controlled detention centres tend to be young to 
middle-aged men who face conflict-related charges or 
have perceived affiliations to armed groups.153

"IV.  SURVIVORS’ PERCEPTIONS, NEEDS, "
"PRIORITIES, AND RISKS"
This section is based on the 20 semi-structured 
interviews conducted in 2021 with survivors of 
"CRSV committed from 2014, and prior to 2022. In "
"the interviews, there were 15 women and five men. "
Information about the demographic profiles of 
participating survivors is available in Annex I. Survivors participating in this Study experienced multiple forms 
"of CRSV, often in conjunction with other conflict-related "
"crimes, particularly arbitrary detention. Their experiences "
have been aggravated by events after the occurrence 
"of CRSV, including displacement, the loss of housing, "
"livelihood, and the disruption of societal and family ties. "
"* Other acts of sexual violence include threat of rape, gang rape and sexual violence, threat of rape of "
"underage daughter, forced observation of rape, deprivation of reproductive hormonal therapy, verbal "
"insults, bathroom under surveillance, forced examination of genitals, forced search, co-detainment of men "
"and women, being photographed and videotaped, ridiculing physical features.ACTS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE EXPERIENCED BY THE SURVIVOR PARTICIPANTS"

"159 This was expressed, for instance, in an informal conversation between Lead Researcher of the Ukraine Study and a member of the SEMA network in March "
"2022, as well as in meetings conducted with members of the SEMA network during a GSF mission to Ukraine in April 2022.In 2021, at the time the interviews for this Study were "
"carried out, survivors expressed their fears of an "
escalated Russian invasion and how it might worsen 
conditions for themselves and their loved ones. In 
"February 2022, those fears became a reality. Despite "
limited contact between GSF and the previously 
"interviewed survivors, it is clear that the invasion "
has led to the worsening of their conditions.159 At 
"the time of finalisation of this report in May 2022, "
the Study partners have not had a chance to speak with survivors of CRSV perpetrated during the 2022 
invasion for the purposes of this Study. The findings 
of the section below result from the analysis of the 20

164 EUCCI01 (3 June 2021).1.1. Psychological impacts
Survivors appear to be most affected by the 
psychological impacts of CRSV. When commenting 
"on their traumatic experiences and resulting needs, "
survivors generally did not separate the impacts of 
CRSV from those of detention.160 They spoke about 
"how deep the overall impact was, with one survivor "
stating that her life in 2014 “ was divided into life 
BEFORE captivity and AFTER captivity ” and that she 
"“became a completely different person. ”161 Additionally, "
some survivors explained their experiences and 
"feelings, without being able to specifically place "
"labels on them. For instance, seven survivors out "
of the twenty interviewed spoke of the general 
"impact of their experience but were not able to or did not categorise it as psychological trauma, nor "
"directly name anxiety, suicidal thoughts, and self-"
"esteem issues, even if those were the symptoms  "
they described.162
Survivors discussed their anxiety as connected to the 
fear of potential future sexual violence perpetrated 
against themselves or their families.163 One survivor 
illustrated her constant fear: 
“ I saw three men at the bus stop talking and 
looking at me all the time. And when I went 
"down into the underground passage, one of "
"them ran – I stopped, my heart began to pound, "
"I think: ‘Well, that’s it!’ – I understand: this is  "
for me.”164TYPES OF PERSONAL IMPACT ON THE VICTIM

Other causes of anxiety included a considerable fear 
"of being in public places, in large crowds,165 or with "
new acquaintances.166 One survivor noted the inability 
"to return to employment, among other ordinary "
"activities.167 Several survivors described feeling unsafe, "
"uneasy, and uncertain.168"
“ It seems to me that I am not living my life. I was 
"active, sociable, able-bodied, I have two children, "
I am the only money earner in the family and the 
main one who deals with ... money. And ... now 
"life has gone a little differently. That is, I no longer "
"have a resource, as it were, with age, and this "
stress that I have endured.”169
A few survivors specifically described depression as a 
psychological effect they experienced.170 Several also 
confessed having suicidal thoughts at different points 
both in detention and upon release.171 A survivor 
claimed it was hard not to go mad in detention and not 
to take one’s own life at the realisation that it was being 
wasted away in captivity.172 The extreme humiliation 
experienced while in detention also contributed 
to survivors’ suicidal ideation.173 Another survivor

181 EUCCI04 (7 June 2021).explained that coping with the traumatic experience 
was so challenging that significant effort was required 
to not take one’s own life amid all that burden.174
A number of participating survivors also reported 
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and specific 
"CRSV-related trauma.175 Survivors described irritability, "
"unpredictable, drastic emotional fluctuations,176 and "
having trouble sleeping.177
Some survivors also referred to the effects of CRSV on 
their self-esteem. One survivor described the gender-
insensitive strip-searching upon her capture in front 
of overwhelmingly male guards. The onlookers made 
"degrading comments about her physical appearance, "
"clothes, and cleanliness.178 About the experience, she said: "
"“ It just humiliates people, it just humiliates "
people...They laughed at the fact that I was not 
quite well dressed there... It simply humiliates  
a person.”179 
Another survivor’s CRSV experience led her to feel 
disgust towards her own body.180 In her own words:
"“ I had some intolerance of my body at some point, I couldn’t "
handle it... I couldn’t take my body completely naked. Normally. 
"Somehow. It was strange. I was ashamed to look at myself.”181IV. SURVIVORS’ PERCEPTIONS, NEEDS, PRIORITIES AND RISKS"
UKRAINE38
Several survivors developed trust issues relating to 
"people182 and institutions,183 such as courts,184 and a "
"reluctance to socialise,185 with one survivor specifically "
citing her lack of trust in men.186 A few survivors 
discussed how their experiences were questioned 
"because they had received aid,187 creating a lack of "
trust.188 As expressed by a survivor: 
"“ Well, I’m telling you, I lost trust in absolutely "
"everyone. In terms of relationships, I trust no "
one.”189
Some survivors also reported a significant 
psychological impact on their children because of 
the stress of having a parent in detention and not 
knowing if they were alive190 and because of the 
forced displacement afterwards.191 Survivors’ children 
became closed off and anti-social.192 They also 
became targets of harassment at school by other 
children.193 One survivor shared about the experience 
of her daughter: 
“ For three days she lay face to the wall and did 
"not turn around. She did not eat, did not go out, "
"for three days she lay statically facing the wall, "
not moving at all and not communicating with 
"anyone, not responding. We tried to somehow "
"to speak to her, she did not react at all.” "

this happened? Why wasn’t she there when I 
really needed her?”194
1.2. Impact on family and society
Survivors reported that their experiences with CRSV 
impacted their relationships with spouses and 
"partners, families, and society. Survivors discussed "
emotional and physical distancing from family and 
friends195 because of the stigmatisation of CRSV;196 
"family, friends, and acquaintances’ fearing backlash "
if they were to help the survivor;197 and geographical 
distance from family due to displacement.198 
An example of stigmatisation faced by survivors 
is others’ presumption that the survivor has 
sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) or acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).199 Survivors 
have experienced a mix of reactions from loved 
"ones – some were belittled,200 while some received "
compassion and support.201

As expressed by a survivor:
202 THBLSSI04 (15 June 2021).“ My social circle narrowed due to the fact of my captivity. After 
"the captivity, I was given a phone with the numbers of all my "
acquaintances. And some did not answer me. Some just threw 
me out of their lives.”202

A few survivors described their hesitancy to connect 
with loved ones or to discuss their CRSV experience out 
of fear of burdening or traumatising their loved ones.203 
Regarding relationships with spouses and intimate 
"partners, a few survivors detailed an end to their "
"relationship, but none say that it directly resulted from "
their CRSV experience.204 A few other survivors detailed 
tensions with their partners for reasons including 
survivors’ increased sensitivity205 and spouses’ perpetual 
questioning about what had happened in detention.206 
Such tension sometimes manifested as aggression or 
emotional distance.207 Other reported causes were 
"financial stress,208 displacement,209 and fallout as a result "
of the survivor’s PTSD.210 One survivor shared: 
“ I woke up every night from some 
kind of nightmare and screamed 
in the middle of the night. And 
"on the third night, [my husband] "
told me in such a rude way that 
’I can’t live like this. What is it? 
"I can’t live like this. Get a grip, "
do something. Stop behaving 
like that. I can’t sleep at night 
because of you.’”211

219 EUCCI01 (3 June 2021); EUCCI3 (4 June 2021).A few survivors reported on the impact of CRSV 
on their relationships with their societies. Due to 
"political and ideological differences, societal ties "
"were broken, and dynamics changed.212 The conflict "
created extreme mistrust and an environment 
perceived by survivors as unreceptive to sharing 
their experiences.213 Survivors also reported that 
the government failed to engage with survivors 
and that there was a lack of sensitivity from  
the government.214
1.3. Physical and medical impacts
Survivors participating in the Study shared about 
their direct physical injuries and secondary health 
issues due to CRSV from 2014 onwards and the 
continued neglect of survivors’ health needs. These 
included both acute injuries that required urgent 
"attention215 and chronic illnesses and injuries,216 "
sometimes residual from the initial injury.217 Survivors 
gave examples such as a hematoma from physical 
beatings218 and the development and worsening 
of health conditions due to the withholding of 
medication and treatment.219 One survivor developed 
a tumour from the lack of hormonal therapy crucial 
for their thyroid condition:
41
"“ I generally have a thyroid disease, and I was "
on hormonal treatment. But when I was taken 
"prisoner, of course, all this stopped – not only the "
"treatment, but even the observation by the doctor "
"... stopped .... Well, the hormone ... the hormonal "
"system, it is interconnected – one cannot say that "
only the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is what 
worried me at that moment. But [it is connected 
"to] all the hormonal organs, so ... failures began "
"in some ... Well, what do I feel? Here I have this "
"constant tickling, coughing ... my thyroid gland "
has enlarged due to the fact that the tumour 
has doubled in size ... I did not take treatment: 
"neither iodine-containing drugs, nor hormonal "
"drugs – and the tumour grew. Well, plus – [it "
led to] complications [in] other organs ... female 
genital organs...”220
"Due to periods spent in detention, where CRSV took "
"place, a few others developed dental issues due to the "
lack of dentistry services.221 Two survivors mentioned 
"reproductive issues, such as difficulties with fertility "
and menstruation.222 Survivors also discussed 
other medical long-term implications that were not 
necessarily connected to CRSV but that had a grave 
impact on their physical and emotional wellbeing.223

Some survivors were displaced after being subjected to 
"violence, including CRSV, with many experiencing loss "
of housing in the NGCA224 and living in poor housing 
"conditions, such as having no heating in brutally cold "
"winters.225 Survivors have also lost employment, either "
due to displacement or because industries were affected 
"by the conflict, such as in realty and construction.226 One "
survivor stated that they no longer felt safe at their place 
of employment due to differing political views.227
"Survivors also experienced loss of subsistence, leading "
to financial instability and associated difficulties.228 For 
"instance, one survivor lost the job and farm animals "
"that used to generate some income for him,229 while "
another survivor had difficulty finding employment 
due to disability.230 Other economic impacts discussed 
resulted from the lack of necessary documents to apply 
"for employment, such as diplomas and licenses, because "
"they were left in the NGCA,231 and injuries affecting "
"employment prospects.232 Furthermore, many people "
"had saved for decades to buy property, but had to leave "
everything behind in the NGCA.233 This meant they 
"could not sell their property, nor would the government "
"assess the lost value, so participating survivors were "
"never compensated for this material loss.234IV. SURVIVORS’ PERCEPTIONS, NEEDS, PRIORITIES AND RISKS"

Survivors reported the significant impact of displacement 
connected to their CRSV experience. Beyond the 
difficulty of being forced to leave their homes and start

"236 THBLSSI03 (14 June 2021).new lives in unfamiliar places without knowing anyone, "
survivors had trouble adjusting due to struggles with 
finances and employment.235
"“ I don’t have a home, I don’t know where to go. And it’s like a "
"scream, a scream in my head... this tension is just oozing.”236"

2. Survivors’ needs
“ You have no one to turn to... no one cares about 
"you. Nobody... And so... if you want to live, then "
"you somehow cope, work with it yourself.”237"
The most prominent needs reported by survivors 
"were medical assistance, psychological support, and "
"social services. Regarding medical needs, survivors "
"discussed the need for affordable, high quality "
"medical238 and dental care239, especially those resulting "
"from CRSV and detention,240 and affordable access to "
"medications.241 Additionally, survivors emphasised "
"the importance of affordable,242 accessible,243 and "
good quality244 psychological and psychiatric 
"professionals,245 and the availability of psychological "
support during court processes.246 They highlighted 
"the need for long-term psychological assistance, as "
short-term is not enough for survivors.247 Survivors 
also discussed the need for these services for their 
families.248

psychologist to me. But they are 500 hryvnias 
"[approximately $16.78] per session, I don’t have "
such an opportunity to pamper myself like that.”249
"Regarding social services, survivors mostly reported "
"the need for housing assistance,250 whether through "
financial assistance for paying rent251 and other 
housing costs252 or by providing housing in a lending 
program.253 Survivors also detailed the need for 
"stable, fulfilling,254 and reliable employment,255 and "
"assistance in the job search process.256 Additionally, "
survivors expressed their need for assistance in 
"receiving pensions257 and formalising documents,258 "
as well as general financial support.259 One survivor 
discussed the issue of losing financial aid granted to 
"displaced persons if they work, which makes it harder "
to live day-to-day.260
“ The need for housing is a security need. A 
"person should be in one’s own house.”261IV. SURVIVORS’ PERCEPTIONS, NEEDS, PRIORITIES AND RISKS"
UKRAINE44
Other needs substantially discussed by survivors 
included legal assistance and security assistance. 
Survivors struggled to find competent lawyers262 
to understand different judicial and administrative 
"procedures,263 such as proving their detention,264 which "
is required to qualify for governmental assistance 
schemes. Survivors also described needing to feel 
safe and protected.265 They additionally reported 
the need for a victim status that acknowledges 
survivors and their rights.266 One survivor described 
a victim status as necessary to protect her from 
"stigma,267 and another survivor saw this status as an "
acknowledgement by the government of the harms 
that survivors suffered.268
“ Having a documented status 
"of a war victim, a victim "
"of my position, a prisoner, "
which would give me social 
"self-awareness, which would "
protect me from stigma. 
Recognising me as victim for 
my position.”269

"document recovery,270 professional requalification,271 "
and an information packet detailing survivors’ 
"rights, resources, and services.272 One survivor also "
"stated a need for essential goods, from homeware "
"to clothes, since survivors lost their property and "
personal items that were left in the NGCA.273 Another 
survivor described their family’s need for assistance 
with advocacy efforts in trying to free a person 
from detention;274 and another expressed wanting 
instructions on how to file cases to the European 
Court of Human Rights.275
“ Taking into account the fact that I was left 
"without anything, everything that I had was left "
"in Donetsk, in the occupied territory, and starting "
"life from scratch, when every single household "
"appliance, pots, plates, everything, everything "
"needs to be bought again. The same for bedding, "
"plus repairs and so on, then of course – this is "
"terrible poverty, because too much is needed.”276"
The remaining needs survivors reported involved 
justice for survivors of CRSV.277 Specific legal 
assistance was mentioned for representation at court 
"hearings, and not only for assisting in applications  "
and documents.278

289 EUCCI07 (24 June 2021).Almost half of the twenty survivors had very little 
to no understanding of reparations as a legal 
"concept,279 with a few having not even heard of it.280 "
Several survivors primarily understood reparations as 
"compensation,281 as a result of World War II.282 Several "
other survivors do not define reparations and go on 
"to detail desired programmes and services, which "
are discussed in the next section.283 Some survivors 
viewed justice and reparations as intertwined.284
“ Reparation is the continuation 
of justice or the completion 
or logical completion of the 
justice process.”285Those who did see justice and reparations as 
connected also believed that survivors have the right 
to demand reparations. One of the survivors aware of 
the right reported that they only became aware of it 
because of efforts by NGOs.286 Another acknowledged 
"the crucial role of NGOs, saying “ if it weren’t for NGOs, "
I would maybe not have survived. ”287 A few survivors 
"outlined their perception of reparations,288 one of "
whom mentioned that reparations are essential and 
should be based on law.289
To build survivors’ understanding of reparations and 
"awareness of their rights, including to reparation, "

"4.  Survivors’ views, expectations, "
and recommendations
4.1. Types of reparations
Survivors discussed the importance of both material 
"and symbolic reparations. For material reparations, "
survivors leaned more towards individual material 
"reparations,290 rather than collective material "
reparations.291 One survivor emphasised the 
"290 A few of the references made by survivors were not specific to individual material reparations, and they asked for material reparations; however, we have "
inferred that they likely mean individual material reparations by the other demands given. EUCCI03 (4 June 2021); EUCCI04 (7 June 2021); EUCCI05 (18 June

4.2. Forms of reparations
4.2.1. RESTITUTION
Restitution was significant to survivors participating 
"in the Study. As stated by survivors, it was imperative "
"“to restore everything that was stolen, what was "
"taken away ”,298 and to “ get them as close to their "
life before as possible ”.299 The two most common 
restitution demands related to the restitution of 
"housing and other property,300 and the restoration "
of personal documents.301 Survivors stated that the 
process for the restitution of civil documentation 
"must be simplified, provided for locally302 and/"
"or centralised electronically,303 and available for as "
many documents as possible.304 It is relatively easy 
"to restore passports and driving licenses, but more "
"difficult for education diplomas, property documents, "
"and “trudova knyzhka”, the document certifying "
one’s history of employment and tax payments.305 A 
survivor also discussed the importance of restoring 
"the infrastructure in conflict-affected areas, especially "
in places close to the contact line.306
4.2.2. COMPENSATION
Survivors seek financial compensation for lost 
"housing,307 particularly for material damages, so that "
they can buy new housing.308 They also mentioned

and medical testing.310 A survivor explained that 
"under certain programmes, they could go only "
"to certain hospitals or practitioners, which limited "
their agency and ability to choose their desired 
medical care.311 They thus explained the importance 
of providing financial compensation in order not 
to restrict their ability to choose where to go for 
medical services.312 Compensation for psychological 
support was also reported.313 One survivor discussed 
compensation for the loss of ability to engage in 
"employment, with additional compensation in cases "
where survivors have children.314 Another stated that 
additional compensation must be paid to loved ones  
and family.315
"“ I want to transport my mother, because she is "

house there so that everything is not looted 
"there. I say, mom, come on ... no, she says, I "

"dear, everything will be plundered, everything "
"will be plundered right there. Now, if we were "
"given this compensation for that house, we "
"would calmly come, make normal repairs here "
and live in peace. And for that apartment in 
"Donetsk, [my mother] would have forgotten "
about it.”316

"In regard to modalities of payments, survivors who "
discussed their preferences mostly preferred monthly 
pensions.317 A few survivors supported free access to 
"services318 and instalment payments,319 but only one "
survivor was in favour of a lump sum payment.320 
One survivor drew comparisons in using monthly 
pensions with what CRSV survivors in Bosnia and  
Herzegovina receive.321

"rehabilitation, survivors identified wanting free, "

Survivors expressed the need for reparations to 
include psychological support for themselves326 and 
for their family members.327 One survivor expressed 
some of the challenges of re-engaging with life  
after captivity: 
“ For a very long time I could not come to my 
"senses. Everything was a shock for me, I learned "
"everything again, I didn’t cook [in detention] "
"for a year, I learned to cook again. I learned "
"to eat with a fork, because [we could only eat] "
"with spoons, and for a long time I couldn’t "
"somehow come to my senses, I considered "
"myself, I had some terrible complexes, I learned "
"to communicate with people again, here.”328"

demand for survivors.329 Survivors recommended the 
establishment of programmes to open up a wide 
array of professions ensuring good income and not 
just for occupations that would grant mere survival.330 
Another recommendation was to have big employers 
connect specific employment opportunities to the 
provision of at least temporary housing.331 Survivors 
also needed professional development programmes 
with individualised support.332 Support for education 
or skills development were brought up in the context 
"of potential impacts on professional opportunities, "
"employment, and earning income,333 which in turn "
would lead to greater feelings of self-worth and a 
higher self-esteem.FORMS OF REPARATIONS – INDIVIDUAL REHABILITATION

“ Maybe learn a new profession. Maybe they lost 
their jobs… Maybe they decided to change their 
"lives altogether. They were so influenced by this, "
"and there, to change the profession as well. Let’s "
"say. That is, it should be a kind of “window” so "
that they can somehow rethink and understand 
themselves and live in peace. And feel safe.”334
Survivors discussed free legal aid upon the release 
"from unlawful detention,335 including through private "
legal advisors assigned to them336 and special courses 
on the basics of law and policymaking337 that would 
"contribute to survivors’ rights awareness, restoration "
"of agency, and the empowerment of survivors to "
meaningfully participate in policymaking discussions.
4.2.4. SATISFACTION
Survivors mentioned public awareness338 and 
acknowledgement339 as an essential form of 
"satisfaction, especially by the Ukrainian Government340 "
and its security forces.341 Justice for survivors of CRSV 
was also highlighted as a form of satisfaction.342 Other 
means of individual satisfaction for survivors were 
connected to receiving a special victim status343 and 
the benefits tied to that.344 One survivor mentioned 
that granting such a status and raising awareness 
about survivors’ activities are vital for their children 
"so that they could see the motivations, sacrifice, and "
heroism of their parents.345

"to me or others, so status recognises, status is an "
acknowledgment that it happened to you. Not 
"that ‘well, there was something. And they are not "

my psychological ... fears or 
some of my unhealed wounds. 
This is what my brain tells me 
that if you think that nothing

are very naive.”347
Survivors who mentioned guarantees of non-
recurrence discussed various measures aimed at 
"ensuring accountability for CRSV, and thereby "
"contributing to its prevention, such as training IV. SURVIVORS’ PERCEPTIONS, NEEDS, PRIORITIES AND RISKS"

state officials on international standards relevant to 
CRSV348 and reforming security forces.349 Survivors 
also stressed the need for deep institutional reform 
"of the Security Service of Ukraine, law enforcement "
"authorities, and the army, as well as ensuring their "
sustainable training on international law.350 One 
survivor expressed her demand for guarantees to 
ensure that her child never experiences war.351
5. Responsibility for reparations
Although survivors expressed doubt about the 
State’s practical will to design and implement a 
"reparation programme,352 most believed that  "
the Ukrainian Government353 should ensure and 
"provide reparations, with the help of international "
"organisations354 and NGOs,355 and that ultimately "
Russia356 should pay for these reparations.357 As one 
participant survivor said: 
"” At this stage, the state must first take on this "
"mission, and then the country [Russia] that is the "
aggressor and that provoked what happened – 
the war and our broken destinies.”358

6.1. Participation
“ I think the victims should be 
involved in this process. Why 
for us but without us?”359
Survivors agreed that survivor participation was not 
just relevant but crucial: a conditio sine qua non  for 
elaborating and implementing reparation policies.360 
All the respondents were ready to participate in such 
"processes,361 and one had already participated in specific "
reparation discussions.362 Survivors’ participation was 
considered vital because they have experienced the 
trauma first-hand and could help policymakers and 
advocates in developing and implementing reparation 
programmes in a survivor-sensitive manner.363 One 
survivor specified that those who are supposed to benefit 
"from a particular policy, especially such an important "
"one as reparations, must indeed actively participate in "
the process developing it as opposed to being passive 
"recipients.364 To genuinely enable participation, survivors "
specified that any participation in consultations on 
53
reparations by survivors should be compensated and 
any costs be reimbursed because many survivors would 
otherwise be unable to participate.365 The state should 
also ensure clear communication and public awareness 
about the available reparation programmes.366
6.2. Role
"“ Well, [survivors] should be getting together. They "
"must discuss, negotiate, speak. In a dispute, truth "
"is born. Write down. And with these demands, "
"requests to go to the higher authorities, well, "
"so that they either help, approve, or somehow, "
somehow at the state level it was decided. This is 
how they should act.”367
"Regarding their specific role, some survivors "
proposed the establishment of survivor’s advisory 
groups within different policy-making bodies.368 
Other suggestions for how survivors may participate 
included: professionally moderated consultations 
"among different groups of survivors,369 various "
survivor organisations’ delegating representatives 
"to express the group’s wishes,370 and questionnaires "
about possible assistance options to discern survivors’ 
preferences for reparations.371
“ I think that the representatives of the [survivors] 
should be in some commissions – at the 
"ministry, somewhere else. So that you can "
control this process yourself.”372

379 EUCCI07 (24 June 2021); EUCCI11 (11 July 2021); THBLSSI04 (15 June 2021).A few survivors reported the importance of supporting 
survivors throughout their participation in processes 
for the establishment of reparation programmes.373 
They suggested that survivors’ indispensable 
participation in the reparation process should be 
publicly announced and acknowledged to empower 
"survivors themselves, especially those who had not "
yet been proactive in sharing their experiences.374 
Survivors also stated that support should be provided 
to survivors’ organisations to ensure their support of 
"each other.375 Additionally, they stated that survivors’ "
participation should be accompanied by experts and 
psychological support.376
"“ Or unite, at least morally support each other. "
"[survivors] At least. Yes, for starters. At least "
"they are, well, it was a circle of people who "
understand each other. That’s it. Something. 
That she is just like me.”377
Some survivors also discussed the possibility 
of creating one large formal organisation or 
association for survivors.378 They stated that any such 
organisation should have lawyers and psychologists 
to help set up and organise the process sensitively 
"and effectively, as well as be present throughout to "
ensure psychological assistance for survivors in any 
triggering moments or to help explain any legalistic 
"complexities or terminology.379IV. SURVIVORS’ PERCEPTIONS, NEEDS, PRIORITIES AND RISKS"

IHL obligations are not only relevant in the context 
of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine; they have 
been in effect since Russia’s illegal occupation and 
"annexation of Crimea, which has been condemned "
by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) since 2014.394 
"Furthermore, Russia’s involvement in the conflict "
in eastern Ukraine and its backing of the ‘LPR’ and

"As an occupying power of Crimea, and potentially "
"of parts of eastern Ukraine, directly and/or by proxy "
"before the 2022 Russian invasion, Russia’s human rights "
obligations extend to this territory.396 This means that 
Russia is responsible for protecting all persons from 
"sexual violence, investigating all allegations of sexual "
"violence, prosecuting and punishing those responsible "
"for human rights violations or violations of IHL, and "
"providing assistance, remedy, and reparations to victims "
and survivors.397 Russia’s human rights obligations are 
applicable concurrently with its IHL obligations.398
"However, Russia’s disregard for its international "
"obligations has been evident since 2014,399 and even "

"In addition, on 7 April 2022, UN General Assembly "

1.3.  Obligations of armed groups 
in eastern Ukraine
Pro-Russia armed groups in eastern Ukraine are not 
parties to international human rights instruments. 
"However, given their level of organisation, territorial "
"control, and some state functions in areas of Luhansk "
"and Donetsk, they must respect human rights standards "
as their conduct affects the rights of individuals under 
"their control.405 However , and as noted in Section III, "
allegations of sexual violence by members of the ‘LPR’ 
and ‘DPR’ are well documented since 2014 and continue 
"in the conflict today, demonstrating a general disregard "
"for human rights standards. Moreover, victims’ right to a "
"remedy in areas under armed groups’ control, including "
"access to justice and reparations, is nearly non-existent. "
59
"For instance, the Phantom Brigade in the Luhansk region "
has put in place several ‘processes’ to address cases of 
"sexual violence, including a ‘people’s trial’ where 340 "
"residents voted on the punishment of perpetrators, who "
"were sentenced to death, in contravention to Protocol "
"No. 6 to ECHR.406 Moreover, these mechanisms were "
"neither independent nor impartial, and instead blamed "
the victims and were derogatory towards them.407
The “Prizrak” Brigade (“Ghost” or “Phantom” Brigade) 
organised ‘the first people’s trial’ to consider two 
"cases of sexual violence on 25 October 2014, in "
"Alchevsk (Luhansk region). Both cases accused men, "
"one of whom was a member of an armed group, "
"of raping young girls, one 15 years old, the other 20 "
years old. In the recorded video of the ‘trial’ published 
"online, the two alleged perpetrators were “sentenced "
to death.” The accused member of the armed group 
was allowed to “go to the front-line to pay his guilt 
with blood”. The fate of the two men was unknown at 
the time of writing this report.
"During the ‘trial’, the commander of the ‘Phantom "
brigade’ stated that “from now on any woman seen 
in a café or a bar will be immediately detained and 
"punished”,  adding that women should sit at home "
if they want to remain loyal to their husbands and 
be a good example to their children.408
As stressed by the International Committee of the Red 
"Cross (ICRC), armed groups exercising control over a "
territory for an extended period of time are bound by 
"IHL rules for the entire duration of conflict.409 As such, "
armed groups must comply with IHL in the conduct of 
hostilities including on the prohibition of all forms of 
sexual violence in situations of armed conflict.

under international law to prevent and address CRSV. 
Survivors of CRSV in the conflict in Ukraine have the 
"right to a remedy and reparations, as CRSV could be "
"a violation of international humanitarian, criminal, and "
human rights law. Dealing with the consequences of 
the conflict includes guaranteeing victims’ right to a 
remedy in its dual components of access to justice 
and reparations. 
2.  The right to a remedy and 
reparations in Ukraine
International human rights law and international 
humanitarian law enshrine victims’ right to an effective 
"remedy, including reparation,410 which is recognised as "
an obligation upon states.411 The Basic Principles and 
Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation 
for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human 
Rights Law and Serious Violations of International 
Humanitarian Law (Basic Principles on the Right 
"to a Remedy and Reparations) outline restitution, "
"compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction, and "
guarantees of non-recurrence as types of reparation 
measures that victims should have access to.412 The 
Guidance Note of the UN Secretary General on 
Reparations for Conflict-Related Sexual Violence 
(the Guidance Note) states that for reparations to 
"be adequate, a combination of these different forms "
"should be made available to CRSV survivors, through "
judicial and administrative channels.413
"As set out in the guidance note, “ reparations should "
be provided by a State for acts or omissions that 
can be attributed to it and that violate its obligations 
under international human rights law or international V. AVENUES FOR REPARATIONS
UKRAINE60
"humanitarian law, or a person, a legal person, or "
other entity found liable for violations of international 
humanitarian law and making reparation. In the event 
that the parties liable for the harm suffered are unable 
"or unwilling to meet their obligations, States should "
endeavour to establish programmes for reparations 
"and assistance to victims. ”414 This section, therefore, "
looks at current and developing frameworks for 
reparations in Ukraine and how they may be a 
foundation for the establishment of reparations 
programmes for survivors of CRSV committed in 
Ukraine since 2014.
2.1.  Policy frameworks for remedy 
and reparation in Ukraine
There has been no comprehensive state policy in 
Ukraine for remedy and reparation for the benefit of 
civilian victims and survivors affected by the conflict 
"since 2014, including CRSV survivors.415 As such, the "
section below deals with developing frameworks 
and strategies that promote or may lead to the 
establishment of reparation programmes. 
"In 2019, the President of Ukraine tasked the Law Reform "
Commission’s Working Group on the Reintegration 
of Temporarily Occupied Territories with creating a 
"comprehensive transitional justice framework, which "
could lead to or include a reparations framework.416 
The outcome document titled ‘ State Policy Concept 
on the Protection and Restitution of Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedoms in the Context of the Armed 
Conflict on the Territory of Ukraine and on Overcoming 
Its Consequences ’ was submitted to the Office of the 
President in September 2020 and has not yet been 
adopted by the President of Ukraine.417 Although 
"the document is not publicly available, the OHCHR "
414 Ibid 4. 
"415 OHCHR, ‘Report on the Human Rights Situation in Ukraine 1 August 2020 - 31 January 2021’ (n9) para 32."
416 The Working Group took the 2018 Draft Law on the Principles of State Policy on Protecting Human Rights in the Context of Overcoming the Consequences 
of the Armed Conflict prepared by civil society as the foundation for the roadmap. Apart from the comments about the incorporation of the four transitional 
"justice pillars to the Roadmap, no more detailed information or the Roadmap’s draft text is publicly available."

generally in line with the UN Basic Principles and 
Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation 
for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human 
Rights Law and Serious Violations of International 
Humanitarian Law ” and “ welcomes [the document’s] 
development. ”418 While this policy document may 
need to be updated in light of the escalation of 
"the armed conflict, its adoption would nonetheless "
advance the legal response to the consequences of 
the armed conflict.
The right to a remedy and reparation is also addressed 
in other policy frameworks adopted by the Ukrainian 
Government before 2022. This includes the Strategy 
for Prevention of and Response to Conflict Related 
Sexual Violence in Ukraine  developed in consultation 
with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister on 
"European and Euro-Atlantic Integration, the Ministry "
of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Justice of Ukraine.419 
The strategy’s fourth component addresses access 
"to justice for victims and survivors, including the "
setting up of a reparation programme. It stresses 
that the setting up of a reparation programme is not 
dependent on the end of a conflict and does not 
need to be linked to transitional justice frameworks. 
"Importantly, the strategy underscores that: “ It will "
be beneficial for Ukraine to hold consultations with 
"affected communities, civil society and experts before "
deciding on the format and reach the best possible 
solution for the Ukrainian context. It is important 
to note that it is recommended that reparation 
programmes be initiated as soon as possible to support 
survivors before the harm becomes irreparable .”420
Ukraine’s National Action Plan on the Implementation 
"of the UNSC Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and "
Security until 2025421 and the National Strategy in 
61
the Field of Human Rights422 reiterate the need for 
a comprehensive transitional justice framework 
for Ukraine. The National Actional Plan urges to  
"“[i]dentify appropriate mechanisms for documenting, "
assessing and compensating victims of conflict-related 
"violence, taking into account the gender perspective "
and bringing the perpetrators to justice.”423 Such a 
framework entails the prosecution of conflict-related 
"crimes, including sexual violence, truth-seeking "
"measures, guarantees of non-repetition, and "
"institutional reforms, all of which require a survivor-"
centric approach.
In the absence of a comprehensive reparations 
"programme, or a dedicated reparation programme "
"for CRSV, survivors are left with limited schemes of "
"governmental assistance (not reparation), including "
on the basis of being a survivor of a crime intersecting 
"with CRSV, such as arbitrary detention. For instance, "
the Cabinet of Ministers’ 2019 Resolution No. 1122 
“On Certain Issues of Social and Legal Protection 
of Persons Deprived of Their Liberty as a Result

justsecurity.org/81558/launching-an-international-claims-commission-for-ukraine/  accessed 25 May 2022.The escalation of the armed conflict in Ukraine since 
the Russian full-fledged invasion on 24 February 2022 
has also prompted new initiatives that may lead to the 
"establishment of a reparation programme. For instance, "
"in April 2022, the President of Ukraine convened a "
meeting with a group of experts in which the creation 
of a special mechanism for the prosecution of conflict-
related crimes and the compensation of victims were 
"discussed.427 While the proposal is still developing, "
it represents an opportunity for the advancement 
of victims’ right to a remedy and reparation and is 
discussed in the section on opportunities below. On 
"20 May 2022, Ukrainian President invited states to sign "
an agreement for the establishment of an international 
"compensation mechanism, specifying that: “ Under such "
"an agreement, Russian funds and property under the "
"jurisdiction of partner countries must be seized or frozen, "
and then confiscated and directed to a specially created 
fund from which all victims of Russian aggression can 
receive appropriate compensation .”428 In advancing this 
"proposal, lessons must be drawn from the numerous "
mechanisms set up in other situations to address 
large-scale compensation and reparation needs in an 
international legal framework.429 
"The significant increase of conflict-related crimes, "
"including CRSV, make the adoption and/or "
implementation of the above-mentioned policy 
frameworks and the establishment of a reparation 
programme more pertinent. Current interventions 
across multiple domestic and international layers 
should be maximised to meet this goal in laying the 
"foundation for a prompt, adequate, and effective "
comprehensive reparation programme.V. AVENUES FOR REPARATIONS
UKRAINE62
"Finally, through direct engagement in 2022 with "
governmental stakeholders and other actors in 
"Ukraine, GSF identified a pressing need for the "
establishment of an urgent interim reparation 
"programme. Such a programme, which would be "
in line with President Zelenskyy’s 2022 proposal for 
the creation of a compensation fund for conflict 
"victims, should comprise interim measures provided "
by states to victims/survivors of gross violations 
of international human rights law and/or serious 
violations of international humanitarian law to address 
the most urgent and immediate consequences 
of such violations and avoid irreparable harm.430 
Urgent interim reparations are granted while victims/
"survivors wait for comprehensive reparation, and "
their establishment is among the guiding principles 
for establishing reparations for victims of CRSV.431 
"For instance, in South Africa, urgent measures were "
"put in place for victims with urgent needs, including "
"medical and material, upon the recommendation of "
the Reparations and Rehabilitation Committee.432
2.2. Judicial avenues to reparations
Case-based reparation frameworks exist in various 
"domestic and international criminal courts,433 but "
such a framework does not exist in Ukraine as 
criminal courts do not issue decisions on reparations 
"relating to the cases before them. Nevertheless, "
domestic criminal investigations and prosecutions 
"are considered, including by some survivors "
"participating in the Study, as a form of satisfaction "

"In Ukraine, claims for compensation from the State "
"for material, moral, and non-pecuniary damages "
can be brought though civil lawsuits.434 Conflict-
related compensation claims have been brought 
"before Ukrainian courts, in which compensation "
"was requested by victims or their family members, "
primarily for damaged property or for harm resulting 
from the injury or killing of civilians since 2014. The 
Norwegian Refugee Council reported that as of 
"October 2018, it had identified 146 pending civil cases "
relating to compensation for damaged or destroyed 
property before Ukrainian courts.435 OHCHR 
"reported that between 16 May and 15 August 2019, "
Ukrainian courts awarded the requested reparation 
(compensation) in four cases brought by families of 
"persons killed during the conflict, to be implemented "
"by the government.436 However, OHCHR also "
expressed concern over the lack of implementation 
"of these judgments, as the government appealed the "
"decisions.437 Shortly after this concern was expressed, "
"however, the state budget included for the first time an "
allocation of 40 million UAH (approximately 1.3 million 
EURO) for compensation to civilian victims of the  
armed conflict.438
63
"In 2019, OHCHR reported on a case before the "
Supreme Court relating to a woman seeking 
reparation for the killing of her daughter in 
the armed conflict in the Luhansk region. An 
earlier ruling by the appeals court obliging the 
government to award compensation for the 
family was maintained by the Supreme Court. 
"While positive, OHCHR notes the continued "
need for a comprehensive mechanism for 
remedy and reparation for injured individuals or 
the family members of those killed during the  
armed conflict.439
"Despite this progress, victims and survivors face "
numerous challenges to bringing compensation 
claims. A significant hurdle relates to the payment 
"of the court fees, a failure of which results in the "
dismissal of the compensation claim.440 Another 
significant challenge relates to the applicable statute 
"of limitation to these cases under the Civil Code, which "
requires plaintiffs to bring compensation claims within 
three years of the occurrence of the violation.441 This 
limitation is a major obstacle for victims and survivors 
"of conflict-related crimes, a majority of whom would "
not be able to meet this deadline due to the ongoing 
"conflict, insecurity, lived trauma, displacement, or the "
time needed for learning about this legal possibility 
"to obtain compensation. Finally, while compensation "
for damages resulting from sexual violence may 
"be possible in a civil case, GSF is unaware of any  "
such cases. 
Judicial channels for obtaining compensation and 
other forms of reparations must be available to 
victims and survivors as part of their right to a remedy.

is in line with international guidance for reparations

2.3.  Access to criminal justice for conflict-
related sexual violence in Ukraine
Concern was expressed at the 2018 Universal Periodic 
Review for Ukraine at the Human Rights Council (HRC) 
over the continued commission of sexual and gender-
"based violence (SGBV),444 including conflict-related "
"violence, both in GCA and NGCA.445 As such, Ukraine "
"was recommended to, inter alia , ensure accountability "
for CRSV and provide victims with adequate support 
"and rehabilitation.446 Relatedly, the HRC also noted that "
the Criminal Code was not in line with international 
standards regarding its provisions on sexual violence.447 
"Since then, however, Ukraine has remedied this by "
reforming the criminal code including through ensuring 
a gender-neutral and broader definition of rape.448
Due to the large scale of conflict-related crimes 
and the limited domestic capacity to address 
"international crimes, the Ukrainian Government "
"focused, in parallel, on triggering the jurisdiction of "
"the ICC and developing domestic capacity. However, V. AVENUES FOR REPARATIONS"
UKRAINE64
"given the complementary nature of the ICC, which "
dictates that national jurisdictions bear the primary 
responsibility for investigating and prosecuting Rome 
"Statute crimes,449 various civil society groups have "
mobilised and called upon the Ukrainian Government 
to build the domestic legal and institutional capacity 
necessary to conduct such investigations and 
prosecutions.450 These efforts were also carried out 
in parallel to a prosecutorial reform that took place in 
"2019, recognising the importance of conflict-related "
investigations at the domestic level.451
"In 2019, the Department of Supervision of Criminal "
Proceedings concerning Crimes Committed during

"Regional Prosecutor’s Offices. However, there remain "
"legal, procedural, and practical gaps in investigating "
and prosecuting sexual violence committed since 
2014 at the domestic level. 
The Ukrainian Criminal Code contains three 
provisions under which CRSV can be prosecuted as 
"an international crime.453 First, Article 433 governs "
violence against the civilian population by Ukrainian 
"servicepeople. Second, Article 434 governs the "
"ill-treatment of prisoners of war, also by Ukrainian "

"While limited in scope, the aforementioned articles, "

"incidents. However, as Article 438 is a ‘blanket article’, "
it does not list the underlying acts or definitions of 
sexual violence crimes. This has created hesitancy in 
using it to investigate and prosecute CRSV amongst 
"law enforcement professionals, many of whom lack "
specialised training on international legal standards 
"relevant to CRSV.454 Instead, law enforcement "
professionals have relied on ordinary sexual violence 
provisions listed below.
PROVISIONS ON SEXUAL  
VIOLENCE AS ORDINARY CRIMES  
IN THE CRIMINAL CODE:455 
• Art. 134: Illegal abortion or sterilisation
• Art. 149: Human trafficking
• Art. 152: Rape
• Art. 153: Sexual violence
• Art. 154: Forced sexual intercourse
• Art. 155:  Sexual intercourse with a person 
under the age of 16
• Art. 156: Molestation of minors
• Art. 156-1:  Harassment of a child for sexual 
purposes
65
Relying on ordinary crimes provisions not only fails to 
fully capture the gravity of sexual violence as a conflict-
"related crime, but also enables the use of formal and "
informal evidentiary standards that are not in line with 
international best practice for sexual violence cases in 
"general, and even more so for conflict-related crimes.456 "
"For instance, while Article 84 of the Criminal Procedure "
Code lists testimony and other types of evidence 
"as possible sources of evidence, they are generally "
not deemed to have sufficient probative value by 
"prosecutors and courts.457 Instead, for cases of sexual "
"violence, including conflict-related, “ investigators and "
prosecutors rely exclusively on certain types of forensic 
"evidence ,” such as tests that can determine penetration "
"and the presence of a struggle.458 However, this type of "
"evidence is unlikely to be available in CRSV cases, which "
"are often reported months, if not years, following the "
"incidents. Without it, though, the cases rarely reach the "
trial stage.459

VI.  ANALYSIS OF OPPORTUNITIES AND 
THREATS FOR REPARATIONS
"486 Iryna Venediktova (@VenediktovaVI), ‘Every #CRSV crime of sexual violence by the RF soldiers...’ (n87).1.  Threats to effective reparations "
for conflict-related sexual violence
1.1  Ongoing conflict and lack of access 
to temporarily occupied or out of 
government control territories
The annexation of Crimea and the Russian occupation 
"of territories in Ukraine remain ongoing, affecting "
the lives of hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians. 
"Moreover, the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine is "
in the spotlight of the political world and the wider 
public. The current conflict continues to carry a 
"threat of CRSV to civilians and protected persons, "
particularly considering the blatant impunity for 
crimes that occurred from 2014. As noted in Section 
"III, reports already show the ongoing commission of "
"CRSV by Russian soldiers. Furthermore, an increased "
lack of access to conflict-affected areas impedes CRSV 
reporting and the provision of assistance and relief to 
survivors and their families.
1.2  Impunity and lack of 
acknowledgment and redress
"Impunity continues for CRSV, with limited "
investigations and prosecutions of CRSV incidents 
committed between 2014-2021 at the domestic and 
"international levels. On 9 May 2022, following the "
Russian invasion of Ukraine and the mounting reports 
"of CRSV, Ukraine’s Prosecutor General expressed "
a commitment to holding to account perpetrators 
of CRSV committed by Russian forces.486 Technical 
"assistance to the Office of Prosecutor General, "
including on evidence standards and on trauma-
"informed and gender-sensitive approaches to investigations, is essential to overcome the challenges "
"presented in section V.2.3, and thereby to ensure "
"accountability, a demand by CRSV survivors as part of "
"reparations. Moreover, the proposed amendments to "
"the Criminal Code discussed in the same section, and "
"which would enable enhanced prosecutions of CRSV, "
have not yet come into effect and are pending the 
signature of the President of Ukraine.
There has been no official acknowledgment of 
"CRSV committed from 2014, nor of its victims. "
Acknowledgment is a key demand of survivors as 
"outlined in section IV, and a starting point for the "
establishment of a reparation programme. The 
Russian Federation and pro-Russia armed groups 
continue to deny the occurrence of conflict-related 
"crimes, and by extension, deprive victims and "
survivors of CRSV of redress including reparations. 
1.3. Lack of survivor consultation
In consultations with survivors participating in the 
"Study, as well as with Study partners, it has been "
expressed that survivors’ perspectives are not being 
sufficiently represented in policy and legal discussions 
"taking place prior to 2022, with an impact on their "
rights and interests. Survivors lacked opportunities 
"to present their views about their priorities, needs, "
and expectations. This contributes to a feeling of 
exclusion and frustration among survivors and 
leads to interventions that do not adequately 
"correspond to survivors’ views, visions, and needs. "
The lack of survivor consultations represents a 
"threat to the adequacy of reparation programmes, "
and the effective and meaningful participation 
"of survivors must, therefore, be a cornerstone of  "
their establishment.VIII. ANALYSIS OF OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS FOR REPARATIONS
""
UKRAINE70
2. Opportunities for reparations
2.1.  Avenues for the establishment 
of an administrative reparation 
programme in Ukraine
President Zelenskyy’s 2022 proposal for the creation 
of a mechanism and a fund to award victims with 
compensation represents an opportunity for the 
realisation of victims’ right to reparation.487 While 
"the development of this proposal is still ongoing, its "
development may lead to the prompt establishment 
of an administrative reparation programme that 
awards victims of CRSV committed since 2014 with 
"compensation, but also other forms of reparations "
"including rehabilitation, satisfaction, restitution, and "
guarantees of non-recurrence.488 This proposal 
can move forward through a presidential decree 
that provides the necessary framework for laying 
out the foundation on which a prompt reparation 
"programme can be established, including the "
establishment of a reparations fund and a registry 
for victims of the conflict from 2014 onwards. The 
"decree could also appoint a working group, with "
"representatives from civil society and survivors, tasked "
"with the preparatory work for advancing reparations, "
such as identifying legislative and policy needs and 
acting as a coordination body. The decree in itself can 
be a form of acknowledgement of conflict-related 
"crimes, including CRSV, and of victims and survivors, "
and may thereby constitute a measure of satisfaction.
2.2.  Current investigations of 
conflict-related crimes
Investigations carried out by the Office of the 
"Prosecutor General in Ukraine and by the ICC, as well "
"as investigations in third countries, may constitute a "
"form of satisfaction for CRSV survivors, should they "

since 2014 as war crimes and/or crimes against 
humanity. The investigation and prosecution of these 
crimes may also serve as deterrence to ongoing and 
"future commission of CRSV, contributing to survivors’ "
demands for guarantees of non-recurrence. 
"Depending on the applicable legal framework, they "
may also lead to awarding victims and survivors with 
other forms of reparations. 
If the ICC investigation develops into cases that 
include SGBC charges and conclude with the trial and 
"conviction of the accused, ICC judges would then "
award victims participating in the case with reparations. 
"However, as seen from other cases before the ICC, "
"it could take years, if not decades, for reparations to "
reach victims. To ensure that victims and survivors 
"receive “ adequate, effective and prompt reparation for "
"harm suffered ”, as articulated in the 2005 UN Basic "
"Principles ,489 investigations at the domestic level should "
"be maximised to deliver not only justice, but also "
other forms of reparations for victims and survivors. 
"Firstly, the criminal justice system in Ukraine should be "
reformed to allow for the provision of reparations in 
connection with prosecuted cases and in accordance 
"with international standards. Secondly, the Office of "
the Prosecutor General in Ukraine can take steps to 
"document harms suffered by survivors, information "
that would also be significant for the design of 
administrative reparation programmes.490 Comparative 
experiences include that of Colombia under the Justice 
"and Peace Law Jurisdiction, created by Law 975/2005491, "
"or the Special Jurisdiction for Peace, created by the "
Colombian Peace Agreement between the Colombian 
"Government and the FARC -EP (2016).492 Moreover, "
the Office can already begin registering victims. If well 
"managed, this could allow victims and survivors to "
access reparations through an administrative process 
"more easily in the future, as those that were part of "
justice processes would not need to register again to 
access administrative reparations.
71
2.3.  Humanitarian assistance and 
development programmes
The right to reparation is clearly distinct from the right 
"to development and humanitarian assistance, with "
"“reparations characterized by an element of redress, "
which acknowledges the harm suffered and provides 
"benefits to remedy that harm, with some component "
"of State responsibility .”493 Nevertheless, the need for "
synergies between development and humanitarian 
"assistance actors and those working on reparations, "
"and transitional justice more broadly, is increasingly "
recognised. A study by the International Center for 
Transitional Justice demonstrates that: 
“Maintaining a focus on victims in development 
"programs, pending the establishment of comprehensive "
"reparations programs, provides interim relief to victims "
"and survivors, mitigating the enduring consequences "
of conflict-related harms and protecting their rights 
and dignity. By embedding a victim focus in ongoing 
development programs or the delivery of government 
services and by consulting affected communities 
about the ways to most effectively target development 
"assistance, the government can leverage these "
programs to promote socioeconomic inclusion and 
address the urgent needs of victims of gross human 
"rights violations. If they are appropriately designed, "
local recovery and reconstruction programs can form a 
foundation upon which reparative approaches can be 
based and built in the future .”494
There are numerous examples of development and 
assistance projects that seek to respond to the needs 
of victims and survivors in contexts with massive 
numbers of victims of conflict-related crimes.495 Some 
of these projects are conducted at the governmental 
"level, such as Chile’s targeted assistance to victims "

GSF projects providing interim reparative measures

assistance and development programmes.497 They 
"provided survivors in Guinea with livelihood support, "
"school fees for children, psychological care, and "
"medical rehabilitation, without losing sight of victims "
"and survivors’ right to full reparations. Indeed, in the "
"Democratic Republic of Congo, GSF, in partnership "
"with a range of actors including survivors, is carrying "
out advocacy aimed at the adoption of a national 
reparation policy for survivors of sexual violence while 
advocating for a response to victims’ urgent needs.
2.4.  Sanctions as an avenue for 
financing reparations
"In response to Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, various "
governments around the world announced forms 
of sanctions against Russia and Russian individuals 
"and businesses, including financial sanctions and the "
"freezing of assets.498 As Moffett describes, “ [t]he purpose "
of sanctions are to censure wrongdoing and to have 
consequences for the wrongdoer. As a countermeasure 
to another party’s breach of an international legal 
"obligation, sanctions revolve around expressing moral "
messages and as a means to vindicate the law .”499 In 
"addition to their deterrence objective, sanctions can also "
put pressure on states to meet their obligations to award 
"reparations, by conditioning the removal of sanctions "
"to the payment of reparations.500 For instance, in 2020, "
Sudan was removed from the list of State Sponsors of 
"Terrorism which it had been on for 27 years, after paying VIII. ANALYSIS OF OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS FOR REPARATIONS"

$335 million to victims of al-Qaeda attacks on U.S. 
embassies in East Africa.501
"Where states have the requisite legislation, sanctioned "
and ill-gotten assets that are frozen by states may be 
"seized and confiscated, and repurposed for financing "
"reparations. In this respect, a lawful confiscation and "
"repurposing regime could have two purposes: first, "
to contribute to halting and preventing international 
human rights and criminal law violations; and 
"second, to address reparation needs.502 Insofar as "
reparations are one of the least-funded post-conflict 
"or transitional justice measures,503 this approach may "
be an avenue to financing reparations for conflict-
"related crimes, including CRSV, in the Ukraine-Russia "
situation. This is even more poignant given Russia’s 
refusal to acknowledge conflict-related crimes to start 
"with, let alone to remedy them. "
"It must, however, be acknowledged that while "
repurposing sanctioned assets for reparations may 
"be possible, it is a complex process and presents "
multiple challenges and legal procedures that may 
take years to navigate. Legislation in most jurisdictions 
requires proof that the assets are ‘ill-gotten gains’ or 
the proceeds of criminal conduct.504 It is therefore 
not adequately equipped to confiscate the assets of 
"Russian oligarchs, whose wealth results from historical "
corruption and is now entwined in purportedly lawful

lack of transparency from states about the presence

towards ensuring that the proceeds of any confiscated 
"Russian assets can be used, at least in part, for the "

respond to the urgent needs of CRSV victims 
and survivors with a ‘do no harm’ approach 
that ensures that victims and survivors are not 
subjected to stigmatisation or further harm in the 
course of the implementation of such projects;
513 Global Code of Conduct for Gathering and using information about systematic and conflict-related sexual violence (Murad Code) (13 April 2022)  
"www.muradcode.com/murad-code  accessed 10 June 2022. • Adopt a rights-based approach in the design, "
"implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of "
"all projects, including by contributing to raising "
"rights-awareness in general, and to the right to a "

incorporating targeted assistance to victims and 
survivors as part of development projects that 
may in their structure and resulting experience 
pave the way for full reparations.
To the international and 
donor community
• Support and fund projects and initiatives aimed 
at responding to the needs of CRSV victims and 
survivors while ensuring that all such initiatives and 
"projects are survivor-centred, trauma-informed, "
"and gender-sensitive, in line with key principles set "
"out in the Murad Code, a global code of conduct "
distilling existing minimum standards to ensure 
information from survivors of conflict-related 
"sexual violence is collected in a safe, effective, and "
ethical way;513
• Take concrete action to further survivors’ access to 
a remedy and reparations including through the 
provision of technical assistance to the Ukrainian 
Government and exploring means to finance 
"interim and comprehensive reparations, including "
through the repurposing of sanctioned assets;
• Provide victims and survivors with a platform to 
engage on policy and legal initiatives wherever 
"their rights and interests are affected. Support, "
"fund, and provide technical assistance to victim and "
"survivors groups, associations, and activists, as well "
as to civil society engaged in supporting them.

VIII. CONCLUSION 
514 THBLSSI01 (13 June 2021).This Study and the voices of participating survivors 
"demonstrate the grave impacts of CRSV on survivors, "
"families, and society, and the urgent need for redress "
through the establishment of comprehensive and 
adequate reparation programmes. Reparations are 
acknowledged as one of the most victim-centric 
measures to deal with the consequences of conflict and 
"conflict-related crimes, and what victims and survivors "
"demand the most. Nevertheless, the establishment "
"of reparation programmes is often unprioritised, "
"insufficiently funded, or fail to acknowledge and "
redress the harms experienced by CRSV survivors.
In demonstrating the grave consequences of CRSV 
in Ukraine and the reality that it continues to be 
"committed in a gruesome manner, the Study submits "
that reparations for survivors of CRSV committed 
since 2014 cannot wait. Urgent action by the Ukrainian 
"Government, the international community, and "
Ukrainian civil society organisations is needed to obtain 
implementation of the above recommendations and achieve effective reparation. This starts with the 
"recognition of CRSV and of its survivors, and continues "
by laying the ground for the prompt establishment 
of a comprehensive reparation programme in line 
with international best practice and lessons learned 
from reparation programmes in other contexts. The 
promotion of survivors’ agency and an active role 
for survivors in the design and implementation of 
reparation programmes is the foundation for ensuring 
that reparations achieve their desired purpose. 
While working towards the establishment of reparation 
"programmes, victims and survivors must be provided "
with urgent interim reparations to prevent irreparable 
and further harm. The frameworks for humanitarian 
assistance and domestic and international accountability 
"must also promote rights-based, trauma-informed, and "
gender-sensitive approaches to working with victims and 
survivors. Doing so would enable responding to survivors’ 
"needs, offer lessons-learned, and provide a foundation to "
build upon for future reparation programmes.
"“ But first of all – to restore everything that was stolen, what was "
"taken away, those lives that were taken away.”514VIII. CONCLUSION"

ANNEX II: GLOSSARY
"515 Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation, Principle 8.The definitions in this glossary are limited to "
the use of these terms in the context of the 
Global Reparations Study and other projects of 
the Global Survivors Fund (GSF).
Survivors and Victims
Survivors. Persons who individually or collectively 
suffered harm as a result of violations of their 
fundamental rights through acts or omissions that 
constitute gross violations of international human 
rights law and/or serious violations of international 
humanitarian law. This non-legal term is often used 
"interchangeably with the term victim (see infra), as "
the latter is the one most generally used in legal 
instruments. The term survivor is seen by many as 
empowering as it emphasises their strength and 
"resilience instead of focusing on their suffering, but "
it is narrower and does not include deceased victims 
or indirect victims. Those who suffered or suffer 
harm are the ones who should decide which term 
"best describes their situation. GSF uses both terms, "
depending on the context and the wishes of those 
who suffered harm.
Victims.  Persons who individually or collectively 
"suffered harm, including physical or mental injury, "
"emotional suffering, economic loss, or substantial "
"impairment of their fundamental rights, through "
acts or omissions that constitute gross violations of 
international human rights law and/or serious violations 
of international humanitarian law. The term ‘victims’ 
also includes the immediate family or dependants of 
the direct victim and persons who have suffered harm 
while intervening to assist victims in distress or prevent victimisation.515 Victims include not only natural 
"persons but also organisations or institutions, and  "
the environment.
Reparations and Remedies
Administrative remedies . Non-judicial mechanisms 
or procedures that victims/survivors of violations of gross 
international human rights law and/or serious violations 
of international humanitarian law can use to access their 
right to reparations and/or to prevent violations. 
Comprehensive reparations.  All measures needed 
to adequately address the harms suffered by victims/
survivors of gross violations of international human 
rights law and/or serious violations of international 
humanitarian law. Comprehensive reparations require a 
"combination of measures of restitution, compensation, "
"rehabilitation, satisfaction, and guarantees of non-"
repetition. The notion of comprehensive reparations 
comes from the concept of ‘integral reparation’ as 
developed by the Inter-American Court of Human 
Rights; its use has now expanded to other bodies and 
legal instruments. 
Collective reparations.  Forms of reparation owed 
to groups of people who have suffered collective forms 
of harm as a result of gross violations of international 
human rights law and/or serious violations of 
international humanitarian law. Such groups are often 
"bound by a common identity, culture, or ancestry. "
"They may also have shared experiences, such as "
living in a community of those with such bonds or 
being subjected to similar violations. These collective 
measures can be symbolic and/or material.ANNEX
UKRAINE80
Domestic/administrative reparation programmes. 
Out-of-court/non-judicial processes or mechanisms 
established at the domestic level by states to 
provide reparation to certain categories of victims/
"survivors when large-scale, gross violations of "
international human rights law and/or serious 
violations of international humanitarian law occur. 
Such programmes are more sensitive to victims’ 
situations and the realities of armed conflict as they 
"are, in theory, meant to provide prompt access to "
reparations at no cost and with a lower evidential 
threshold than required before a court. In such 
"programmes, states identify the violations and the "
victims/survivors to be redressed and provide them 
with reparation through an established procedure.
Judicial remedies.  All judicial and quasi-judicial 
mechanisms and procedures at the national or 
international level to protect survivors’ rights or to 
adjudicate cases involving the international crimes 
they have suffered. Many of these mechanisms can 
also order or recommend forms of reparation for 
"the survivors. Their decisions are, per se, a form of "
satisfaction.
Judicial reparations . Measures awarded by judicial 
or quasi-judicial bodies to redress victims/survivors 
through a judgment or decision at the end of a legal 
process.
Remedies.  Appropriate mechanisms that seek to 
address a gross violation of international human 
rights law and/or serious violation of international 
humanitarian law and are provided by the State or 
other duty-bearers.
Right to reparation.  Right of victims of gross 
violations of international human rights law and/or 
serious violations of international humanitarian law. 
It consists of measures that the State or other duty-
bearers must provide in response to those violations 
to recognise and address their consequences and 
the society’s structural and gender inequalities that 
uphold systems of discrimination and violence. 
Reparations that victims/survivors are entitled to are 
generally recognised to include the five following 
"516 United Nations, ‘Guidance Note of the Secretary-General on Reparations for Conflict-Related Sexual Violence’ (n413) Guiding Principle 4; Nairobi Declaration "
"on Women’s and Girls’ Right to a Remedy and Reparation (March 2007) International Meeting on Women’s and Girls’ Right to a Remedy and Reparation, "
"Nairobi, Kenya; González et al. (“Cotton Field”) v. Mexico  (Preliminary Objections, Merits, Reparations and Costs) Inter-American Court of Human Rights Series "
C No. 205 para. 450.
"517 United Nations, ’Guidance Note of the Secretary-General on Reparations for Conflict-Related Sexual Violence’ (n413) Guiding Principle 7. forms: restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, "
"satisfaction, and guarantees of non-repetition. These "
five forms of reparation are not mutually exclusive but 
complement each other as each addresses different 
needs that victims/survivors may have.
Reparation fund. Legal body or entity established at 
"the domestic, regional, or international level to manage "
funds and provide reparation to specific categories 
of victims/survivors of international human rights law 
and/or international humanitarian law violations. A 
reparation fund can have different purposes depending 
"on the mandate given, such as providing reparations to "
victims/survivors or assisting them in meeting their 
"needs (e.g., physical rehabilitation, material support, or "
psychological rehabilitation).
Symbolic reparations.  Measures aimed to  
acknowledge and facilitate the recognition of victims/
survivors and the violations of international human rights 
law and/or international humanitarian law violations that 
have occurred. Fully symbolic reparation measures can 
"include public apologies, commemoration initiatives, "
"preservation of memory, the change of names of "
"public spaces, and the creation of museums, parks, "
or memorials dedicated to the victims/survivors. 
All reparation measures should include a symbolic 
"dimension (e.g., providing compensation along with an "
act of acknowledgement of responsibility).
Transformative reparations.  Reparation measures 
that aim to have a transformative effect by addressing 
"socio-cultural injustices, political, economic, gender, "
"and structural inequalities, rather than simply bringing "
"victims/survivors back to the status quo ante,  one of "
inequality and discrimination. Doing so would merely 
reinstate or reinforce the structural conditions within 
society that allowed the violations to occur in the  
first place.516
Urgent interim reparation. Interim measures 
provided by states to victims/survivors of gross 
violations of international human rights law and/or 
serious violations of international humanitarian law to 
address the most urgent and immediate consequences 
of such violations and avoid irreparable harm.517 It 
81
should not be confused with humanitarian or other 
assistance measures. Urgent interim reparation is 
based on the recognition of State responsibility and 
requires State and political support. It is granted while 
victims/survivors wait for comprehensive reparation. 
"Such measures have been provided by states in, for "
"example, South Africa or Timor-Leste."
Forms of Reparation
Compensation.  Monetary measures that seek 
to address harms by economically assessing and 
quantifying them. These harms can include economic 
"loss, loss of one’s life plan, physical and mental harm, "
and moral damage.518
Guarantees of non-repetition/non-recurrence. A 
key form of reparation that includes different measures 
aimed at addressing the structural causes of the 
"violation, including any kind of discrimination, that can "
"contribute to preventing further violations, such as (a) "
ensuring effective civilian control of military and security 
forces; (b) ensuring/putting in place justice system 
reforms and strengthening the independence of the 
judiciary; (c) providing international human rights and 
international humanitarian law education to all sectors 
of society and training for law enforcement officials 
as well as military and security forces; (d) reviewing 
and reforming laws and practices contributing to or 
allowing violations of international human rights and/
or international humanitarian law; (e) working with all 
sectors of society to challenge expressions of patriarchal 
power and transform masculinities; (f) fostering an 
enabling environment for civil society; (g) investing 
"in education, arts, and other cultural interventions.519 "
Guarantees of non-repetition do not depend exclusively 
"on State actors: civil society organisations, religious "
"and community leaders, artists, and educators, among "
"others, have a crucial preventive role and contribute to "
creating and sustaining an environment conducive to 
the full realisation of rights. 
"518 Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation, Principle 20."
"519 Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation, Principle 23. See also UNGA, ‘Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion "
"of truth, justice and guarantees of non-recurrence’ A/72/523 (12 October 2017)."
"520 Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation, Principle 21."
"521 Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation, Principle 19."
"522 Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation, Principle 22.Recognition. Form of satisfaction for victims/"
survivors. It is the acknowledgement of the victim/
"survivor as an individual, who has a value of their "
"own, and an acknowledgement of the fact that they "
have suffered gross violations of international human 
rights law and/or serious violations of international 
"humanitarian law, that they are not responsible "
"for what happened, and that they are entitled to "
reparations to address the harms they suffered. It 
implies the consideration and acknowledgement 
of how the person has been affected and has 
suffered due to the environment and actions of 
others. Recognition can take place through different 
"measures such as the investigation, prosecution, "
and punishment of perpetrators; a public apology; 
or the provision of reparations as part of a domestic 
reparations programme.
Rehabilitation. Measures that include all essential 
services that victims/survivors need to carry out 
"their lives in a dignified way. It includes adequate, "
"comprehensive, and timely medical and psychological "
"care, as well as legal and social services.520"
"Restitution. Measures that, whenever possible and "
"advisable, seek to restore the victim/survivor to the "
original situation prior to the violations. Restitution 
can include measures such as restoring someone’s 
"liberty or enjoyment of rights, return to their place of "
"residence, or restoring employment.521"
Satisfaction . Forms of reparation that aim to 
provide victims and survivors with a sense of dignity 
and recognition. Different types include (a) measures 
aimed to stop continuing violations; (b) full and public 
disclosure of the truth; (c) search for the whereabouts 
of disappeared persons and the remains of those 
killed; (d) official declarations or judicial decisions 
"that restore the dignity, reputation, and rights of the "
"victims and their next of kin; (e) public apologies, "
including acknowledgement of the facts and 
acceptance of responsibility.522ANNEX
UKRAINE82
Interim Reparative Measures
Interim reparative measures . Term coined by GSF 
to refer to measures provided to victims/survivors of 
gross violations of international human rights law and/
or serious violations of international humanitarian law 
"by non-duty bearers (e.g., international organisations, "
"civil society organisations, and other actors) in "
situations where states or other duty-bearers are 
unable or unwilling to comply with their responsibility 
to provide reparations. Receiving these measures 
does not substitute the obligations that states or other 
responsible parties have to provide reparations. 
Assistance 
Assistance/relief. Provision of resources or services 
that aim to respond to the basic needs of populations 
"suffering from armed conflict, natural disasters, "
or other human-made crises. They are generally 
provided as part of development aid and humanitarian 
assistance programmes.
Interim assistance/relief. Provision of resources 
or services that apply during a particular period 
to respond to the urgent and immediate needs of 
"populations suffering from armed conflict, natural "
"disasters, or human-made crises."
Principles and Approaches
Co-creation.  Methodological approach developed 
by GSF in which survivors/victims develop reparation 
processes and measures and other activities concerning 
"their rights; as right holders, they play an active role in "
"the mapping, design, implementation, monitoring, and "
evaluation of such processes/activities.
Do No Harm. This key ethical principle seeks to 
"ensure that actions, assistance, processes, or other "
interventions do not have unintended harmful 
consequences. Interventions must not cause any 
"further damage and suffering, either physical or "
"psychological, on victims/survivors or otherwise put "
them at risk.Informed consent. Legal and ethical obligation 
"requiring that victims/survivors, witnesses, or other "
"persons participating in interviews, research, or any "
other activity provide voluntary consent based on full 
disclosure and comprehension on how the information 
"provided will be used, which information will be kept "
"confidential, how the information will be protected, "
and the potential risks that the use of information could 
have for their safety and well-being. The ability to give 
voluntary informed consent is based on a general 
requirement of having the competency to do so.  
Gender-sensitive. Approach that seeks to analyse 
"and acknowledge how acts, experiences, violence, and "
harms can have different meanings and impacts for 
"individuals because of their gender or gender identity, "
"sexuality, or sexual orientation. This approach should "
"be used in the mapping, design, implementation, "
"monitoring, and evaluation of reparation processes. "
It should include the adoption of safeguards against 
"gender biases, adequate training, and the development "
of gender-sensitive research methodologies.
Participation.  The process by which affected 
"individuals or groups of people, such as victims/"
"survivors, take part in an activity. It can imply different "
modalities and levels of involvement. Regarding 
"reparation measures, victims/survivors have a right "
"to participation, which should be meaningful and "
"effective throughout the whole process of mapping, "
"design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation."
Survivor-centred. Approach that places survivors 
"at the centre of the process by prioritising their rights, "
"needs, and wishes and ensures they are treated with "
"dignity and respect. Often, the term survivor-centred "
refers to the actual approach of working with victims/
"survivors. The term survivor-centric refers to the policies, "
"procedures, and broad responses that prioritise the "
"rights, needs, and wishes of the victim/survivor."
Trauma-sensitive. Approach that seeks to 
understand and consider the impact that trauma can 
have on victims/survivors; acknowledges and respects 
that the responses to trauma are different for every 
victim/survivor and vary depending on a broad range 
"of factors, including culture, gender, age, beliefs, "
"socio-economic status, the existence of a supportive "
environment or education level.
83
Sexual and Reproductive Violence
Conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV).  Acts 
or patterns of sexual violence against people of all 
genders and ages occurring during a conflict or 
post-conflict setting that have direct or indirect links 
with the conflict or that occur in other situations of 
concern such as in the context of political repression.523 
CRSV includes all violations of a person’s sexual 
autonomy and sexual integrity; it can be an expression 
of discrimination exacerbated by the conflict and is 
"generally characterised by humiliation, domination, and "
"destruction. CRSV can take many forms, including but "
"not limited to acts of rape, forced pregnancy, forced "
"sterilisation, forced abortion, forced prostitution, sexual "
"exploitation, trafficking for sexual purposes, sexual "
"enslavement, forced circumcision, castration, sexual "
"torture, forced nudity, or any other form of sexual "
violence of comparable gravity.
Forced marriage. Marriage in which one and/or 
both parties have not personally expressed their full 
"and free consent to the union. In the context of CRSV, "
the term forced marriage is often mistakenly used to 
"refer to conjugal or sexual slavery, which takes place "
"when a person is made to serve as a de facto spouse, "
coerced to conduct acts or carry out tasks of both 
"sexual and non-sexual nature. Child marriage, a union "
in which at least one of the parties is under 18 years of 
"age, is considered forced marriage."
"523 United Nations, ‘Guidance Note of the Secretary-General on Reparations for Conflict-Related Sexual Violence’ (n413) 2.Sexual slavery. Situation in which a person exercises "
ownership over one or more persons and coerces 
them to engage in an act or acts of a sexual nature.
Sexual torture. Acts of a sexual nature that are 
"intentional, cause severe physical or mental suffering "
"to the victim, and are committed for a specific "
prohibited objective or purpose such as obtaining 
"information, punishing, intimidating, or any other "
discriminatory reason. It can also include threats to 
commit those acts and the real danger of being 
subjected to them. For various international and 
"domestic judicial and quasi-judicial bodies, torture "
also requires the involvement or acquiescence of a 
public official.
Sexual violence. Acts of a sexual nature or attempts 
to obtain a sexual act or other acts which target sexual 
functions against people of all gender and ages 
committed without consent or in a coercive context 
that makes genuine consent impossible. These acts 
violate their sexual autonomy or sexual integrity; 
sexual violence is an expression of discrimination that 
"is generally characterised by humiliation, domination, "
"and destruction. Under certain conditions, sexual "
"violence can amount to genocide, crimes against "
"humanity, and war crimes.ANNEX"

ABOUT RESCORE UKRAINE
"reSCORE Ukraine, which is a joint initiative funded by the USAID and "
"UNDP , and implemented by SeeD, continues to serve as an annual "
assessment tool of societal resilience and recovery that informs the 
"policies and programming of national, regional, and international "
"partners. Like its predecessor, the Ukraine SCORE 2018 to 2021, it "
"aims to identify pathways and respond to complex needs, geared "
"at strengthening individual and collective coping mechanisms, and "
"fostering a democratic, just, inclusive, and cohesive Ukraine. "

GENDER SNAPSHOT / Findings from the Ukraine reSCORE 2023
Around 4 in 10 of all respondents feel that their households 
can afford food and clothes but not more expensive goods. 
Women with disabilities and internally displaced women report 
"lower income , with 16% and 14% stating that they cannot afford "
"food, respectively. Internally displaced women also report a "
dependency on welfare payments (58%) and humanitarian aid 
"(40%).  Of women in the poorest households, just 18% have "
"access to basic medical services, 12% can afford medicine, and "
6% have access to specialised medical services. These women 
report low physical health status and high levels of Anxiety.
Respondents report an overwhelming lack of psychosocial 
"support services, reported as sufficiently available by just 26% of "
men and 27% of women. Rural women are more likely to report 
a lack of all services. Women survivors of domestic violence 
"report higher levels of marginalisation , with 46% reporting that "
they have been marginalised due to their income and 36% due 
"to their education, compared to 21% and 16% of other women, "
respectively.
Levels of Anxiety and Depression have been increasing since 
"2021 in Ukraine, and women consistently report higher levels "
in both . 16% of women say that they very often have trouble 
"getting themselves to stop worrying, and 10% say that they very "
often feel depressed or very sad. Women survivors of domestic 
"violence have high levels of Anxiety and Depression, with 23% "
reporting that they very often have trouble getting themselves to 
"stop worrying, and 17% reporting that they often feel depressed "
or very sad.
"Personal security is low in women survivors of domestic violence, "
"women in low income households, and women with disabilities. "
Only around one in ten of women in these groups feel safe alone 
"in the street at night , and they express low levels of confidence "
in the police. Only around one third of respondents believe that 
bomb shelters are sufficiently available where they live. Almost 
one in five respondents has witnessed fighting or shelling. 17% of 
men who lived under occupation report that they were physically 
"assaulted and 15% that they were imprisoned without cause, "

A significant proportion of respondents still believes that women 
"should have more delicate jobs  (66% of men, 60% of women). "
Over half of men believe that they should have the final word in 
"household decisions (51%), that women are too emotional (54%), "
and that a woman should take care of the children if the man can 
provide (51%). Less than one third of respondents think that the 
right to have an abortion and the freedom to express one’s sexual 
orientation or gender identity are absolutely necessary human rights 
(31% and 28%). Approximately half of respondents (51%) report 
that they would not want people who identify as LGBTQI+ in their 
"communities, a slight increase since 2021, and 46% think that the "
right to marry for same sex couples is totally unnecessary.
Civic engagement and resistance are high in both women and men. 
"Among all activities, people are most engaged in volunteering or "
"donations (55% of men, 59% of women), and in activities to improve "
"their neighbourhoods (51% of men, 54% of women). Despite women "
"being highly active and vital in civic life, they are still underrepresented "
in politics. This is also visible in women’s perception that politics as

GENDER SNAPSHOT / Findings from the Ukraine reSCORE 2023
Russia’s full-scale military invasion has exacerbated existing gender 
inequalities and given rise to new issues for women and girls in 
"Ukraine. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, women and girls "
have been disproportionately affected and have faced a number 
"of adversities, including, but not limited to forced displacement, "
"heightened risks of violence and abuse, unemployment and economic "
"insecurity, and low access to basic services and resources1. Under "
"such conditions, the advancement of gender equality and women’s "
empowerment in Ukraine remains particularly challenging.
Gender equality is identified as Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 
#5 in the United Nation’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development2. 
While Ukraine had made moderate progress in achieving gender 
"equality prior to the 24th of February 2022, the full-scale Russian "
invasion affects the possibilities for the fulfillment of SDG #5 not 
"just in Ukraine, but also in surrounding countries, in Europe and the "
European Union as a whole. Achieving SDG Targets 5.4 (on unpaid 
"care and domestic work), 5.5 (participation and equal opportunities "
"for leadership at all levels of decision-making), 5.6 (universal access "
"to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights), and "
5.c (sound policies and enforceable legislation for the promotion 
of gender equality) forecasted to be particularly challenging for 
Ukraine3.
One of the most significant recent strides towards achieving 
gender equality in Ukraine has been the ratification of the Europe 
Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women

"and Domestic Violence (the Istanbul Convention) in June 20224, "
which demonstrated Ukraine’s commitment to fighting violence 
against women and domestic violence even during wartime5. With 
multiple sources6 indicating the continuing rise of gender-based 
"violence in Ukraine during the full-scale war, certain provisions of the "
"Istanbul Convention become particularly relevant during wartime, "
and framing violence against women and girls as a human rights 
issue is crucial7. 
Acknowledging the disproportionate impact of armed conflicts on 
women and girls and calling for the application of a gender lens and 
"the recognition of the specific needs of women and girls, in 2000, "
the UN Security Council adopted the Resolution 1325 (S/RES/1325) 
"on women, peace and security (WPS). As a policy framework, WPS "
recognises the crucial role of women in efforts to achieve sustain -
able international peace and security and stands on four pillars: 
"participation, protection, prevention, relief and recovery8. In line with "
"the WPS agenda, in 2016 Ukraine approved the first National Ac -"
tion Plan (NAP) to implement the UN Security Council Resolution 
1325 for the period up to 20209. The second NAP 1325 adopted in

2020 for the period up to 202510 was developed with the technical 
support of UN Women. The devastating consequences of Russia’s 
ongoing full-scale war against Ukraine on the lives of women and 
"girls are giving even more urgency to WPS agenda, considering the "
"heightened risks of gender-based violence, conflict-related sexual "
"violence, human trafficking, exploitation due to lack of basic safety "
"and security, loss of regular income, and massive displacement11."
"At the same time, women are playing a vital role in Ukraine’s "
"response to the war by taking care of their families, participating "
"in civic life and civic resistance, making political decisions on local "
"and national levels, working as volunteers, providing humanitarian "
"assistance, and serving in the Ukrainian military. This exists against "
"the backdrop of women’s unpaid care burden, which is increasing "
"during wartime12, and their role as income earners. Subsequently, "
involvement of women will be essential to the country’s recovery 
and reconstruction. 
This analytical report presents a snapshot of reSCORE 2023 survey 
findings on the impact of Russia’s full-scale military invasion on the 
lives of women in Ukraine in the identified key domains: Economic 
"Security, Access to Services and Basic Needs, Physical and "
"Psychosocial Wellbeing, Personal Security, Support for Gender "
"Equality, and Participation in Civic Life.  It aims to gather evidence "
about the specific needs of and challenges faced by Ukrainian 
"women, and to provide evidence-based recommendations to the "
relevant national and international actors to facilitate their activities 
tied to both humanitarian response and Ukraine’s post-war recovery 
and reconstruction.

GENDER SNAPSHOT / Findings from the Ukraine reSCORE 2023
Women with the lowest income levels are less likely to report that 
Ukrainian authorities care and correspondingly have the lowest levels 
of Trust in local institutions16. These women also have low physical 
health status and health security17. Women with disabilities report 
the lowest levels of household income18. Women with disabilities are 
more than twice as likely to report that they lack money even for food 
compared to the general population (16% compared to 7%).
Internally displaced women also report lower household income  than 
"other women, and more frequently use humanitarian aid and welfare "
services19. Internally displaced women are two-fold more likely to report 
that they lack money even for food compared to the general population 
"(14% compared to 7%). Elsewhere, reports stress that 34% of internally "
displaced women rely on regular wages as their main source of 
household income20. One in ten (11%) older women and women survivors 
of domestic violence surveyed in the reSCORE say that their household 
lacks money even for food.
Almost 6 in 10 (58%) women who are internally displaced use welfare 
"payments frequently, compared to 36% of women in the general "
population. Humanitarian aid is frequently used by 40% of women who are 
"internally displaced, compared to 7% of women in the general population. "
Women who previously lived under occupation are also heavily dependent 
on humanitarian aid (28% use this frequently). Women with disabilities 
"are also more dependent on welfare payments21, with 62% using these "
frequently. Approximately three quarters of older women use welfare 
"payments frequently (73% of women over the age of 65, compared to 46% "
"of women aged 55 to 64, and around 20% of younger women)."
"Perceptions about Economic security have improved slightly since 2021, "
"with mean scores of 5.1 out of 1022 in 2023, compared to 4.5 in 2021, "
"in the national representative samples23. Unlike household income, "
"differences in Economic security, although significant, are small between "
"men and women, with scores of 5.2 and 5.0 out of 10, respectively24. The "
components of Economic security are shown in Table 1 .

Women survivors of domestic violence report low provision of 
"public services overall , and low internet access compared to women "
in the general population33. Women who feel marginalised for any 
reason report low provision of welfare services34. 
In addition to the lower levels of sufficient access to basic and 
emergency medical services that women in low income households 
"report ( Table 1 ), just over half of these women (54%) report efficient "
provision of health care in their locality ( Table 2 ). Under one third 
(30%) of women in low income households have efficient access 
"to basic utilities, over two times lower than other groups ( Table 2 ). "
Women in low income households also report lower access to 
"justice than women elsewhere (25% compared to 35%, Table 2 ). "
Women who lived under occupation report lower provision of 
"welfare payments (59%), administrative services (49%) and roads "
(24%) compared to other groups ( Table 2 ). They also report lower 
"availability of waste disposal, housing, cash and childcare, as well "
as cultural or leisure facilities compared to women in the general 
population ( Table 3 ). These agree with previous findings of lower 
levels of access to services for women in conflict-affected areas35. 
"This also indicates that the experience of occupation, which weakens "
"public service provision (including undermining childcare, Table 3 ), "
"intensifies the vulnerability of women in particular, as they already "
face heightened insecurity and more obstacles when accessing the 
job market.
"Overall, women report higher levels of usage of basic schooling, "
"health care, welfare and public transport services than men36. As "
"noted previously, women with disabilities, women who are internally "
"displaced, and women in low income households are the most "
"frequent users of welfare payments, with 62%, 58% and 47% using "
"these frequently, respectively. Internally displaced women and "
women who previously lived under occupation are the most frequent 
"users of humanitarian aid, with 40% and 28% using these frequently, "

Women survivors of domestic violence are more likely to report that 
"they, or those close to them, have been treated unfairly based on "
"any social characteristics, particularly due to their level of income "
or education ( Table 4 ). Almost one in two (46%) women survivors 
of domestic violence report that they have been treated unfairly 
due to their income level . This is higher than women in low income 
households report. 
"With reports postulating that war conditions negatively influence domestic violence38, women may "
"increasingly find themselves in cycles of heightened vulnerability, in which their social networks and "
"economic security dwindle. These may reverberate vertically to affect women’s perception of the state, "
as women who are marginalised also report more Perceived corruption39.

Women report lower levels of Personal security than men55. The 
lowest levels of Personal security among women are reported by 
women survivors of domestic violence56 and women in the lowest

Almost one quarter  of both women (22%) and men (24%) who lived 
"under occupation have witnessed someone being shot, wounded, "
or violently attacked  (Table 7). More than 80% also witnessed actual 
fighting or shelling and 13% of men and 8% of women have 
witnessed someone being killed  (Table 7). Men who lived under 
occupation were more likely to report that they have been physically 
"assaulted (17%) or detained or imprisoned without cause (15%) , "
"compared to women (4% and 2%, respectively,  Table 7). Approximately "
four in ten respondents who lived under occupation report home or

"and support, such as the National Police Telegram chat-bot."
 Increase awareness about and coverage of police mobile 
teams for domestic violence response.
 Scale up and increase visibility of National Police capacity 
"strengthening efforts, such as the UN Women and National "
Police	of	Ukraine	trainings	 that	were	held	across	the	country60.
	 Ensure	 that	authorities	 adequately	 respond	 to	all	cases	of	
gender-based violence.
 Ensure that women survivors of domestic violence have 
"effective,	 efficient	 access	to	protection	 orders	and	to	adequate	"
shelters.
" Increase the collection of disaggregated statistical data, "
"including	 making	 this	publicly	 available,	 particularly	 with	"

"Despite the consequences of Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, the "
Government of Ukraine has demonstrated its commitment to women’s

"policies and legislation between 2022 and 2023. In this light, Ukraine’s "
post-war recovery and reconstruction offer an opportunity to address 
many long-standing inequalities between men and women61.
Gender equality mindset has increased in both men and women  since 
"2021, from 6.0 to 6.5 out of 1062. Gender equality mindset in women is "
correlated with a higher Sense of civic duty63. The biggest decreases

respondents who agree that women should have more delicate jobs 
"(from 77% to 63% in the full sample), that men should not cry  (from "

Gender equality mindset is higher in women than men64. Two 
thirds  (66%) of men and 60% of women still believe that women 
should have more delicate jobs  (Figure 8). More than half of men 
believe that men should have the final word when important 
"household decisions are being made  (51%), that women are too "
"emotional and this affects their judgement  (54%), and that women "
should take care of the children if the man can provide  (51%). One 
in ten men (11%) believe that a husband can discipline his wife to 
correct her behaviour . The biggest difference in the views of men 
and women centre around household decision making (51% of men 
"and 28% of women believe men should have the final word), though "
a staggering proportion of women still support this statement. Over 
one third (36%) of men and 22% of women think that men should 
"not cry , and 18% of men and 23% of women think that men cannot "
take care of children on their own.

Women are slightly more likely to report that the freedom to

War’s Gendered Costs: The Story of 
Ukraine’s Women
Akanksha Khullar
NOVEMBER 2022
2Russia’s invasion of Ukraine entered 
its eighth month in late October and 
shows no sign of abatement. The war 
has had massive consequences on 
"Ukraine, and women and girls are "
bearing the disproportionate burden. The conflict 
has further exacerbated gender inequities that were already compounded by eight years of armed 
"conflict in eastern Ukraine and, beginning in early "
"2020, by the COVID-19 pandemic. This report "
seeks to fill the gaps in literature on the massive 
consequences of the conflict on Ukraine’s women. Abstract
"Attribution: Akanksha Khullar, “War’s Gendered Costs: The Story of Ukraine’s Women,” ORF Special Report No. 199 , November "
"2022, Observer Research Foundation. "
"3On 24 February 2022, Russia "
commenced a full-scale military 
"invasion of Ukraine. Since then, 6,114 "
"civilians have been killed and 9,132 "
"wounded,1 and extensive damage "
has been wrought on infrastructure including 
"hospitals, schools, and residential houses. Economic "
"conditions have deteriorated, and food insecurity "
has heightened. Human rights organisations accuse 
Russian soldiers of indiscriminate attacks that violate 
"the laws of war.2 Only a week into the hostilities, over "
one million people had already fled their homes to 
"seek refuge elsewhere, including in foreign lands. "
"In March 2022, the International Criminal Court (ICC) opened an investigation into alleged war "
crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine3 
"amidst reports of women being raped, civilian "
"deaths, and destruction of entire cities. However, "
given that Russia had withdrawn from the ICC 
in 20164—after the court called the Crimea 
annexation an “occupation”—and Ukraine is 
unable to refer to the alleged war crimes by itself 
"as it is not an ICC member, no action has yet been "
taken.5Introduction
"4Amidst the devastation caused by the war, it is the "
women and girls who are bearing the worst impacts. 
This gendered view of the Russia-Ukraine conflict 
has yet to be given the attention it deserves. This 
special report is therefore an effort to understand 
how the first eight months of the Russian offensive 
has impacted the lives of Ukraine’s women and 
girls. It uses secondary sources including reports 
"published by the Ukraine government, international organisations, and aid agencies who are working on "
the ground; as well as media coverage and reports 
by various United Nations (UN) agencies. The 
author has also conducted interviews with experts 
"on gender issues, as well as Ukrainian individuals "
who have experienced Russian atrocities in the 
past and are currently settled in other countries.
Only a week into the 
"hostilities, over one million "
Ukrainians had fled their 
homes to seek refuge 
elsewhere.
5Ukraine has recorded significant 
progress in bridging gender 
"inequities in the past decade. Indeed, "
since the 2013 Maidan revolution6—
also known as ‘the revolution 
of dignity’—women in Ukraine have become 
"increasingly engaged politically, economically, and "
socially. 
"In 2017, Ukrainian women mirrored the global "
"#MeToo movement, calling it “I’m Not Afraid to "
Say”7—a campaign that revolved around issues of 
"rape, sexual harassment, and domestic violence. "
The campaign gave women a voice and boosted their 
confidence in speaking out against their aggressors. 
It also paved the way for a new law that criminalises 
domestic violence—previously considered only a 
civil offense—providing resources for the setting up 
"of shelters, registry for offenders, and hotlines.8Data also highlights the slow but steady rise in "
women’s political participation—from 3 percent 
of parliament seats in 1990 to more than 20 
percent in 2021.9 Following local elections in 
"October 2020, 42 percent of village councils and "
28 percent of regional councils are today led 
"by women,10 which in part can be attributed to "
the addition of gender quotas and affirmative 
action to the country’s elections code. The same 
patterns are seen in local politics: there has been 
a 13-percent increase in the proportion of women 
"nominated as candidates by political parties, and "
a 12-percent rise in the share of women elected as 
councillors.11Women’s Rights in Ukraine:  
A Brief History
"6At the same time, Ukraine has ratified or joined "
most international agreements on gender equality.a 
"Furthermore, to guide its security efforts and ensure "
the incorporation of gendered perspectives across 
"various fields, Ukraine has adopted a National "
"Action Plan, which supported the implementation "
of UNSC’s WPS agenda as early as 2016 for a period 
"up to 2020, and its successor for the period up to "
2025.12
"Despite progress, however, gender inequities "
"remain persistent, buoyed by patriarchal norms "
that promote discrimination and systemic biases 
"against women and girls. Indeed, Ukrainian women "
continue to face serious barriers to meaningful 
"economic, civic and political participation, which "
"are hindered further by risks of economic fragility, "
"poor health outcomes, and exposure to violence. "
A 2019 study  by the United Nations Population 
Fund (UNFPA) found that 75 percent of Ukrainian 
women reported having been the subject of some 
"form of violence since the age of 15, with one in every "
three having experienced sexual violence.13 In spite 
"of changing mindsets, the labour force participation "
rate of women also continues to remain lower than that of men.14 For those who are part of the labour 
"force, they suffer a 22-percent pay gap compared "
"to their male counterparts, as well as a 32-percent "
"gap in pensions.15 Moreover, women comprise "
more than 72 percent of all recipients of social 
"assistance, and they shoulder the greatest burden "
of unpaid domestic and care work in households.16
These inequities—deeply embedded in 
Ukraine’s social fabric—have been compounded 
by the war that has raged in eastern Ukraine 
since 2014. The past eight years of conflict in the 
eastern part have not only deepened pre-existing 
"inequalities but have created new ones, increasing "
"women’s exposure to war crimes, especially "
"gender-based violence, arbitrary killings, rape, "
and trafficking. More than 1.5 million people—
nearly two-thirds of them women and children—
have already been displaced internally due the 
conflict and do not have access to essential services 
"such as healthcare, housing, and employment.17"
a	 These	include	the	Beijing	Declaration	and	Platform	for	Action	of	the	4th	World	Conference	for	Women;	the	Convention	of	the	
Elimination	of	All	Forms	of	Discrimination	against	Women	(CEDAW)	and	its	Optional	Protocol;	International	Labour	Organization	(ILO)	
"conventions;	and	the	United	Nations	Security	Council	(UNSC)	Resolutions	on	Women,	Peace	and	Security	(WPS)."
7The COVID-19 pandemic then came to Ukraine 
"on 3 March 2020,18 threatening the gains, however "
"modest, that have been made viś-a-viś women’s "
"rights, particularly in economic empowerment and "
"access to healthcare. This experience is, however, "
not unique to Ukraine. Like their counterparts 
"in many other countries in the world, Ukrainian "
women have now been placed at a higher level 
"of subjective poverty and economic insecurity, "
"experiencing lower employment rates, insufficient "
"access to medical services, and increased exposure "
to physical and psychological domestic abuse owing 
to the prolonged restrictions on mobility.19
These negative consequences are even more 
acute for women belonging to minority groups 
"including Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), "
"Roma women,b and women with disabilities. These marginalised groups have had to face additional "
"challenges related to residence registration, lack "
"of work and livelihoods, and limited access to "
medical and social services.20 
"There is no doubt, therefore, that gender "
inequities are persistent in Ukraine—in part 
"owing to patriarchal structures, and also as a "
result of the past eight years of internal conflict 
and the COVID-19 pandemic. It is amidst these 
compounded challenges that Russia’s full-scale 
invasion of Ukraine has severely impacted social 
"cohesion and the resilience of local communities, "
and worsened gender inequities. 
"b	 Romas	are	an	 ethnic	group 	of	traditionally	itinerant	people	who	originated	in	northern	 India	but	live	in	modern	times	 worldwide ,	"
"principally	in	 Europe.	There	are	some	50,000	people	in	Ukraine	who	self-identify	as	Roma."
8The women of Ukraine have not been 
mere spectators in the prolonged 
conflict. From when the conflict first 
"erupted, Ukrainian women have "
fought in the military and territorial 
"defence forces, and have served on the diplomatic "
and informational front lines. They have also saved 
"lives as doctors, nurses, hospital workers, and "
volunteers. Those living overseas have organised 
mass protests calling for an end to the war.
Disregarding both their significant contributions 
"and their additional burdens, decision-makers "
"have largely kept women on the sidelines, whether "
"on humanitarian efforts, peace-making, or other "
"areas that directly impact their lives. At the formal decision-making level, the centralisation of power "
and increased role of the military has only made 
it more difficult for women to exert influence 
in political and administrative decision-making 
processes. Women’s lack of participation has 
further failed to ensure that their needs and 
"priorities, including of those most vulnerable and "
"marginalised, are being given adequate attention "
and thereby mitigated.The Gendered Impacts of 
the War
9Additional Caregiving Burden 
The Russia-Ukraine war is causing a re-distribution 
"of family roles and functions, thereby adding to the "
onerous plight of women. Women in Ukraine have 
customarily been viewed as the primary caregivers 
and domestic workers tasked with the responsibility 
"of nurturing their families, especially the children "
and the elderly. They have limited control over 
"assets and productive resources, and are required to "
do most of the work on fulfilling the humanitarian 
"needs of displaced people, locals and households. "
"Indeed, 95 percent of single-parent households are "
"headed by single mothers.21,22 "
As Russia’s assault on Ukraine led to the 
"destruction or closing down of hundreds of schools, "
"childcare and eldercare centres, and hospitals, "
women’s care burden has increased manifold. 
"This has left them little time, if at all, to care for "
themselves. Compounding the care burden are other 
consequences of war such as strained community 
"resources, high demand for volunteer work, and "
the absence of men. The martial order issued by the Ukraine State Border Guard Service—right at the 
beginning of Russia’s invasion as tens of thousands 
of civilians fled the country—mandated men 
between 18 to 40 years old to stay back and fight.23 
"Thus, the women are no longer dealing with only "
the increased caretaking or unpaid work demands 
but are also responsible for making up for the lost 
household income. According to the May 2022 
Rapid Gender Analysis report of the UN Women 
"and CARE, “More and more women from diverse "
backgrounds in Ukraine were becoming involved 
in volunteering and providing assistance ever 
since the war commenced and also performing 
vital roles in the humanitarian response in local 
"communities.”24 In this sense, the ongoing war "
has brought about a shift in gender roles where 
more and more women—in the absence of their 
husbands—are emerging as heads of household. 
10Migration and Displacement
"As of March 2021, the United Nations Human "
Rights Commission (UNHRC) confirmed that there 
were almost 1.5 million internally displaced people 
"in Ukraine, of which 58.56 percent were females "
and 41.44 percent were males.25 Experience in past 
conflicts has shown that military interventions can 
cause a migration crisis or else amplify an existing 
"one, where women and children are among the first "
to be displaced. This brings the risk of double or 
triple displacement for those who have been already 
displaced. 
"Amidst Russian shelling and bombing, Ukraine "
is being confronted with an unprecedented crisis 
of great numbers of women and children fleeing 
their homes to search for a better life or simply to 
"stay alive. According to the UN, as of July 2022, at "
least 12 million people have fled their homes since 
"Russia’s offensive began.26 Of this number, more "
than 5.2 million have left for neighbouring countries 
and are being recorded as refugees across Europe; 
more than 3.5 million of them have applied for 
temporary residence in a foreign country.27 Within 
"Ukraine, some seven million people are internally "
displaced.28The UN’s International Organisation for 
Migration (IOM) estimates that more than half of 
those either fleeing the country or are displaced 
are women.29 The IOM data suggests that as of 
"July 2022, at least 65 percent of women are still "
trying to find safety in different parts of Ukraine.30 
These numbers are only expected to increase 
significantly in the coming months as the offensive 
continues.
"Yet, it is not the displacement alone that "
increases the security risk for Ukrainian women 
and young girls. As thousands of refugees seek 
"shelter and safety, the danger of women being "
trafficked heightens as they look for help for 
themselves and their children. Exploiting their 
"situation and vulnerability, traffickers offer "
"transport, work or accommodation, thereby "
luring women to leave with them.31 
These situations could lead to sexual exploitation 
"where women are forced to trade sex for shelter, "
"transport or safety. In addition, women who have "
been forced to flee often rely on hastily opened 
and unvetted sources of shelter—many of which 
are overcrowded and under-resourced. In many 
"of these shelters there is poor hygiene, lack of "
"basic supplies, and absence of safety measures, "
together posing a direct threat to the health and 
lives of women.32 
"11Some groups of refugees have in fact, faced "
additional barriers to reaching safety where the 
existence of shelter has not necessarily guaranteed 
access. There are reports of Roma women and 
children—who are facing immense challenges in 
their attempts to cross the border given their lack of 
economic resources and basic legal documentation—
being forced to queue for long hours until all 
ethnic Ukrainians are processed.33 This housing 
discrimination and segregation in poor conditions is 
together only adding on to the problems of women 
"belonging to minority communities, putting them at "
even greater risk.
Impeded Access to Health Services
"Prior to Russia’s invasion, the women of Ukraine "
"were already suffering from lower health outcomes, "
including in mental health.34 As protection 
structures and support systems have broken down 
"as a result of Russia’s military offensives, there is a "
massive contraction in routine health services and 
"restrictions, which in turn has created additional "
barriers to women’s access to even basic health 
services such as sexual and reproductive care.
"Damage and destruction of medical facilities, "
along with a shortage of service providers and 
"critical supplies, have severely compromised the "
delivery of health services such as maternal care for 
"the estimated 265,000 women who were pregnant "
"when the conflict erupted,35 and specialised services for gender-based violence survivors. The World "
Health Organisation (WHO) has said that by 
"24 March, at least 64 hospitals and healthcare "
facilities had been bombed and shelled.36 In one 
"incident, on 9 March, a maternity hospital in "
"Mariupol was bombed, resulting in the death of at "
least one pregnant woman and her unborn child.37
Lack of access to healthcare has thus become a 
"serious problem for those remaining in Ukraine, "
with medical supplies diminishing as the conflict 
"continues. In the past six months of the war, "
pregnant women in Ukraine—shielding from 
Russian bombardment and to protect their 
babies—have been reported giving birth in subway 
"stations, underground shelters, basements and "
"bunkers.38 Estimates suggest that nearly 80,000 "
women  are likely to give birth in the next three 
months in Ukraine.39 If these expectant mothers 
continue to be deprived of critical maternal 
"health services, they will be forced to give birth "
"in difficult conditions, endangering their own "
life and that of their child. This could have 
detrimental impacts not only on their physical 
"health but also their mental well-being. Indeed, "
the stress of war and limited access to healthcare 
could together overload women’s capacity to 
"cope, further leading to an increased number of "
"pregnancy complications, premature births, and "
stillbirths.
12Life has not been easier for those who have fled 
"Ukraine. Upon their arrival in a foreign country, "
migrants—majority of whom are women—are facing 
immense difficulty to access healthcare services 
primarily due to lack of registration documents or 
"because those health systems are already overloaded, "
"to begin with, and thereby further stressed by the "
multitude of refugees arriving in a very short period 
of time.40
Sexual Violence and Rape
Gender-based violence has remained persistent 
"in Ukraine, with 90 percent of cases of violence "
targeting women.41 According to a study  published 
"by the UNFPA in 2019, 75  percent of Ukrainian adult "
women have experienced some form of violence 
"since the age of 15, with one in every three reporting "
having experienced physical sexual violence.42 
There is no dearth in evidence to prove that the 
outbreak of conflict often deepens inequities and 
"creates new ones, further increasing the exposure of "
women and girls to various forms of dehumanising 
"experiences, including rape, violence, torture, and "
exploitation.43 
"Since the Russian invasion, there have been "
reports of women being raped following the 
execution of their husbands; and of women being 
raped in front of their family members—a deliberate tactic to tear apart the fabric of the Ukrainian 
"family, break the spirit of the women, and instil "
a sense of hopelessness and despair.44 A national 
"hotline set up to monitor cases of domestic violence, "
"human trafficking, and gender-based violence has "
received multiple reports of sexual violence.45 
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights 
"has said that as of 3 June 2022, the Human Rights "
Monitoring Team had received reports of 124 
alleged acts of conflict-related sexual violence 
across Ukraine.46
In a June 2022 UN Security Council (UNSC) 
"meeting, Pramila Patten, the Secretary-General’s "
Special Representative for Sexual Violence in 
"Armed Conflict, reiterated the UN’s commitment "
to prevent sexual violence in Ukraine and 
prosecute perpetrators. She told the council 
that there is a gap between the international 
resolutions aimed at preventing rape and other 
"sexual assaults during conflicts, and the reality "
"on the ground for the most vulnerable, women "
and children in Ukraine.47 She stressed upon the 
elements of the Framework of Cooperation on 
the Prevention and Response to Conflict-Related 
Sexual Violence48 agreed upon by the Government 
of Ukraine and the Office of Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence.  
13The framework—signed on 3 May—aims to 
enhance protection and response to conflict-related 
sexual violence in the military context of Russian 
"operations in Ukraine. So far, however, Russia has "
continued to deny all allegations of sexual violence. 
"Russia’s ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, "
has repeatedly emphasised that Russian soldiers are 
subject to strict rules prohibiting violence against 
civilians. He has accused Ukraine and Western 
members of the Council of issuing allegations 
without evidence.49
For rape victims either in Ukraine or among 
"those finding shelter in a foreign land, their health "
risks are significant. They are at high risk of 
"sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV , as well "
as pregnancy and internal physical injuries—these 
would all require specialised medical assistance that 
may not be available amidst the ongoing conflict.
Education
"According to Ukraine’s Education Ministry, over "
"1,800 schools and universities have been damaged "
or destroyed since the Russian invasion.50 Other 
"schools are being used as information centres, "
"shelters, supply hubs, or for military purposes by "
"both warring parties. As a result, millions of boys and "
girls in the past eight months have been deprived 
"of proper education, with young girls being at a particular risk of losing years of schooling and "
social development. Save the Children notes that 
"in areas of conflict like Ukraine, girls are 2.5 times "
more likely to be out of school than boys.51 The 
COVID-19 pandemic has already shown how 
educational disruptions make it more difficult for 
girls to return to school once the crisis dissipates.52 
Some children have turned to online schooling 
"initiated by the Ministry of Education. Girls, "
"however, are finding it difficult to even engage "
with these online sessions due either to increased 
"care burden at home, the unwillingness of parents "
"to allow them, or the lack of access to digital means."
Putting girl’s education on the back-burner 
will prove detrimental for the girls’ own 
health—they will be at greater risk of early 
"marriage, early pregnancy and child birth, and "
gender-based violence. It also threatens their 
financial independence and other parameters 
"of social empowerment, while having additional "
"repercussions on the welfare of her own family, "
"her community, and the larger economy."
14Food and Energy Crisis
Ukraine is a major source of wheat for the World 
"Food Programme, which provides food assistance "
to 115.5 million people in more than 120 countries 
"across the globe.53 Meanwhile, Russia is one of the "
"world’s top three crude oil producers, as well as the "
second largest producer—and largest exporter—
"of natural gas.54 Even before the war, Ukrainian "
women’s access to food and energy had historically 
been more precarious than men’s; women-headed 
households were more likely to be food insecure.55 
The ongoing war has added another challenge to 
the crisis as it has massively disrupted production 
and export processes and essential commodities are 
becoming increasingly scarce. These shortages drive 
price hikes in turn. The cost of food in Ukraine has 
"risen by 50 percent since the beginning of 2022, "
whereas crude oil prices—currently up by 33 
percent—are projected to rise above 50 percent by 
"the end of the year.56When there is not enough food to go around, "
women in patriarchal societies are required to 
cut down their own intake to save food for other 
members of the household. This trend has become 
"glaringly visible in Ukraine, driving worsening "
malnutrition and anaemia among women and 
young girls.57
With their access to resources such as land 
or financial credit as well as formal employment 
"now becoming more limited than ever, along with "
"the expanding gender gaps in pay and pensions, "
Ukraine’s women are not only dealing with the 
rising food and energy crisis but are also left with 
no credible assets to fall back on.
15The women of Ukraine are  
shouldering a disproportionate 
weight of Russia’s military invasion: 
they are left without access to services; 
burdened with additional unpaid 
work; and have become even more vulnerable 
to sexual violence and abuse. There has been no 
accountability on the part of political leaders to 
adopt measures that will ensure that the women’s 
"concerns are being heard. At the same time, there "
has been no show of accountability at the global stage 
to safeguard and protect the women who are being 
massively affected by the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
The imperatives in Ukraine include safeguarding 
"the health, dignity and rights of women and girls. "
This report makes the following recommendations 
to prevent the further regression of women’s rights 
in Ukraine. 1. Ukrainian women need to be included 
in decision-making platforms on de-
"escalation, conflict prevention, mitigation "
and other processes. 
2. National and international efforts must be 
made towards scaling up the delivery of 
life-saving sexual and reproductive health 
"services, medical equipment and supplies, "
and strengthening the network as well as 
resources of civil society organisations that 
could provide assistance to women whose 
lives have been upended by the conflict.
3. Accountability can both act as a deterrent 
for the crimes that are being carried out 
against the Ukrainian women and help 
bring about a decrease in sexual violence 
"during peacetime. Thus, there is an urgent "
need to ensure accountability—whether in 
international or domestic jurisdictions—
for sexual and gender-based crimes in 
Ukraine. Conclusion
164. The gendered element of all war crimes 
must be emphasised and highlighted during 
"international trials, and must be taken into "
account as courts hand out their decisions 
and sentencing. 
5. Funds need to be raised and investments 
made in educational programmes directly 
targeted at Ukrainian women and girls.
6. Promote and protect the right to food by 
targeting the specific nutrition needs of 
women and girls.7. The international community along with 
the national forces must actively listen to 
"women activists, IDPs, doctors, nurses, and "
"those fighting on the frontlines, and work "
to mainstream their needs and concerns 
across all levels.

"The world was horriﬁed on Sunday by a picture taken by thephotographer Mikhail Palinchak on a highway 20km outside the capital,Kyiv, in which the bodies of one man and three women were piledunder a blanket. The women were naked and their bodies had beenpartially burned, the photographer said.The harrowing image adds to a mounting body of evidence thatsummary executions, rape and torture have been used against civiliansin areas under Russian control since the Kremlin launched the invasionof its neighbour on 24 February.Particularly diﬃcult for many to comprehend is the scale of the sexualviolence. As Russian troops have withdrawn from towns and suburbsaround the capital in order to refocus the war eﬀort on Ukraine’s east,women and girls have come forward to tell the police, media andhuman rights organisations of atrocities they have suﬀered at the handsof Russian soldiers. Gang-rapes, assaults taking place at gunpoint, andrapes committed in front of children are among the grim testimoniescollected by investigators.“We have had several calls to our emergency hotline from women andgirls seeking assistance, but in most cases it’s been impossible to helpthem physically. We haven’t been able to reach them because of theﬁghting, ” said Kateryna Cherepakha, the president of La Strada Ukraine,a charity that supports survivors of traﬃcking, domestic violence andsexual assault.“Rape is an underreported crime and stigmatised issue even in peacefultimes. I am worried that what we learn about is just going to be the tipof the iceberg. ”Rape and sexual assault are considered war crimes and a breach ofinternational humanitarian law, and both Ukraine’s prosecutor generaland the international Criminal Court have said they will openinvestigations into reported sexual violence. But what currently seemslike a far-oﬀ possibility of justice has done little to assuage Ukrainianwomen’s fears of what may yet happen in a war that is far from over.Antonina Medvedchuk, 31, said that when she woke up to the sound ofbombing on the day the war broke out, the ﬁrst things she grabbedbefore leaving the north suburbs of Kyiv were condoms and scissors touse as a weapon to protect herself.20/06/2024, 00:52Page 2 of 7"
"“Every break between curfew and bombing I was looking for emergencycontraception instead of a basic ﬁrst aid kit, ” she said. “My mother triedto reassure me: ‘This is not a war like that, they don’t exist anymore,they are from old movies. ’ I have been a feminist for eight years, and Icried in silence, because all wars are like this. ”It is not only Russian soldiers Ukrainian women may have to protectthemselves from. In Vinnytsia, a town in the west of the country, ateacher reported to police that a member of the territorial defenceservices dragged her into the school library and tried to rape her. Theman was arrested.Organisations such as La Strada Ukraine and a countrywide networkcalled Feminist Workshop have been working online and with localgovernment to distribute information about medical, legal andpsychological support available for victims of sexual assault, and aretrying to ﬁnd safe shelters for women and girls ﬂeeing both the war anddomestic violence.They fear, however, that the trauma caused by the use of rape as amilitary tactic will lead to deep suﬀering across Ukrainian society foryears to come.“When a woman gets away it looks like she’s safe, she’s far away fromthe guns and the man who raped her, ” said Sasha Kantser, externalaﬀairs manager for Lviv Feminist Workshop, which has helpedhundreds of displaced women and girls since the war broke out.“But the trauma is a bomb inside her, that follows her. The scale of whatis happening now is heartbreaking. ”• The headline of this article was amended on 4 April 2022 to betterreﬂect the article.TopicsUkraineRape and sexual assault/Europe/news20/06/2024, 00:52Page 3 of 7"

"have experienced sexual violence or know someone a!ected by it.There is evidence that Russian commanders in several instances were aware ofsexual violence by military personnel in Ukraine — and in some cases,encouraged or even ordered it — according to an international criminal lawyerassisting Kyiv's war crimes investigations.British lawyer Wayne Jordash told Reuters that in some areas around the capital ofKyiv in the north, where the probes are most advanced, some of the sexual violenceinvolved a level of organization by Russian armed forces that speaks to planning ona more systematic level. He didn't identify speciﬁc individuals under scrutiny.ADVERTISEMENTThe previously unreported ﬁndings by investigators about the alleged role ofcommanders and the systematic nature of attacks in some locations are part ofpatterns of alleged sexual violence that are emerging as Russia's war in Ukraineenters its ninth month.Jordash, who is part of a Western-backed team that provides legal expertise toUkraine, said it was too early to conclude how widespread the practice was becauseinvestigations in recently recaptured areas of the northeast and south are at anearlier stage. However, the patterns suggest that sexual violence may be even morefrequent in territories that were occupied for longer periods, he added, withoutproviding evidence.Victims ranged from 4 to over 80: UN-mandatedreportReuters interviewed more than 20 people who worked with alleged victims —including law enforcement, doctors and lawyers — as well as an alleged rape victimand family members of another.They shared accounts of alleged sexual violence by Russian armed forces thatoccurred in various parts of Ukraine: many included allegations of family membersbeing forced to watch or multiple soldiers participating or acts being conducted at20/06/2024, 00:53Page 2 of 10"

Widespread orsystematic sexual violence could amount to crimes against humanity, which aregenerally seen as more serious, legal specialists said.Moscow denies war crimes, targeting civiliansMoscow, which has said it is conducting a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine,has denied committing war crimes or targeting civilians.In reply to Reuters questions about alleged sexual violence by the Russian military20/06/2024, 00:53Page 3 of 10"

Ukraine's probe is at the centre ofmultiple e""orts to investigate potential war crimes related to the conﬂict, includingby the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague.Evidence that sexual violence was planned could indicate it was part of a systematicattack or that some level of command was aware, said Kim Thuy Seelinger, anadvisor to the ICC on sexual violence in conﬂict and a research associate professorat Washington University in St. Louis.Woman ordered to hang rag outside her houseA woman from the village of Berestianka, near Kyiv, told Reuters that shortly afterRussian troops arrived in March a soldier ordered her to hang a white rag outsideher house. He returned that night with two other Russians, according to thewoman, who asked to be identiﬁed only by her ﬁrst name, Viktoriia.ADVERTISEMENTShe said one of them, who she took to be a commander because he appeared to bemuch older and because that's how the others referred to him, told her the twoother soldiers were drunk and wanted to have fun.According to Viktoriia, 42, those two soldiers walked her to a neighbouring house,where one shot and killed a man when he tried to prevent them from taking hiswife.The two soldiers then took both women to a nearby house, where Viktoriia said shewas raped by one of them. The other woman was also raped, according to thatwoman's sister and Viktoriia. Reuters was unable to reach the second woman,whose family said she had left Ukraine."

"Ukrainian internally displaced women atrisk of sexual and gender-based violenceFMR 72 – Ukraine: Insights and implicationsSandra Pertek, Irina Kuznetsova and Iuliia TsarevskaSeptember 2023Internal displacement in Ukraine brings with it increasedrisks of sexual and gender-based violence. Recent researchfindings offer recommendations to reduce risks in transitand to support internally displaced women with housing,access to work and mental health support.Russia’s war on Ukraine has given rise to mass population displacement, primarily of women andchildren (as few men between 18 and 60 are permitted to leave the country). Mass populationdisplacement has continued since 2014 when over 1.5 million people from Eastern Ukraine and Crimeafled to other regions of the country. The new phase of aggression, initiated on 24 February 2022, hasdisplaced over 5.4 million people internally.[1] Returnees from international displacement add to theIDP population, with over 4.7 million Ukrainians who had fled to Poland being recorded crossing theborder back into Ukraine by August 2022.[2] Many are unable to return to their homes and aretherefore internally displaced.Displacement experience is gendered. Between 2014 and 2021 a greater military presence in someareas of Ukraine was associated with increased reports of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV)incidents at checkpoints.[3] While SGBV is widely defined as “any harmful act that is perpetratedagainst one person’s will and that is based on socially ascribed (gender) differences between males andfemales”,[4] there are different types of SGBV, including sexual, physical and psychological violence.This study, drawing on the SEREDA project[5], conceptualises that SGBV manifests across a continuumfrom pre-displacement, conflict and transit, to places of refuge.[6] The paper draws on researchconducted by the University of Birmingham with a Ukrainian NGO (Convictus) and community-basedresearchers between May and June 2022. It included 15 semi-structured interviews with female IDPs inWestern Ukraine and discussions with multiple stakeholders, in addition to 17 interviews with Ukrainianwomen in Poland, some of whom were previously displaced in their homeland.[7] Convictus isspecialised in SGBV response and their daily experience of working with survivors in Ukraine isreflected in this article.thDOWNLOAD PAGEHomeAbout FMRExplore ContentWrite For FMRSupport FMRDONATEDONATE20/06/2024, 00:56Page 1 of 7"
"Violence in conflict and in transitExtensive evidence indicates that internal displacement increases the risk of violence along forceddisplacement routes. Our study corroborates existing evidence and reveals how the risk of SGBVincreases along internal transit routes in Ukraine and even upon arrival in places of refuge in WesternUkraine. This occurs for multiple reasons, from loss of resources and economic destitution to traumaand shock, which all affect IDPs’ vulnerability to exploitation.While some respondents revealed single incidents of violence or talked about their acquaintances’experiences of violence, others experienced different types of violence from pre-displacement throughconflict, transit and refuge. All respondents were subjected to and witnessed armed violence and life-threatening events in their hometowns and during displacement. In several accounts, women did notwant to leave their husbands behind as they valued them as their protectors. Living in and fleeingoccupied territories was described as a terrifying experience. Many recalled being confined tobasements and shelters for days and weeks during airstrikes.Many women were afraid of becoming victims of conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV). Severalrespondents shared indirect information (which they heard from family, colleagues and social media)about the rape of Ukrainian women and children by the Russian army:We had girls from a neighbouring village who had been taken to the hospital as the result ofviolence…I have a friend who works at the hospital, she was on duty for 42 days non-stop… shesaw them all after the operation. One doctor said – I couldn’t see where to sew up the wound.It was terrible.(Oksana[8])Gendered violence during transit was widespread, including sexual harassment and physical andemotional violence. In particular, women and transgender women and men on buses and trains weresubjected to insulting comments and sexual harassment by drunk militia. Risks of trafficking weredescribed as high, with some recounting stories of women and men who disappeared during theirjourneys by train and road.Some women tried to appear less attractive by wearing loose clothes and cutting their hair. Some saidthat men at roadblocks harassed young women and did not let them pass, for example saying: “We arenot going to let you leave. Pretty women mustn’t leave Kherson.”SGBV in the labour marketMost IDPs in Ukraine faced destitution and depended on friends, relatives and civil society. Some didnot know how to apply for state benefits (which were, in any case, insufficient to meet IDPs’ basicneeds). Some continued their jobs online. However, most became unemployed, which increased theirvulnerability to exploitation in the informal labour market. For example, a 20-year-old female IDP inWestern Ukraine worked in two chain restaurants for two weeks each on probation without payment.Many considered labour exploitation as discrimination against IDPs. Some IDPs explained thatemployers did not want to hire them due to their lack of permanent residency.Women were also targeted through apparent job offers on social media. Some were offered sex workdisguised under vacancies within the hospitality sector. For example, after advertising her cleaningservices, a young female participant started receiving messages from men requesting the inclusion of20/06/2024, 00:56Page 2 of 7"
"sex services. Another young participant disclosed how, during an ordinary job interview, she and herpartner were offered work in the pornography industry.Few received any information about the risks of SGBV or how to seek support. The Ukrainian policewere described as insensitive to emotional and economic violence among IDPs, with a tendency toblame victims.SGBV in accommodationSafe housing is essential for preventing SGBV and helping victims to cope with trauma. There was ashortage of available accommodation for IDPs in Ukraine, and landlords were easily able to manipulaterent costs, providing minimal living conditions for vastly inflated rents. Some locations lacked basicamenities and safety checks. Many IDPs lived in overcrowded accommodation with other people indistress, which reinforced their trauma. For example, one woman who lived in a hostel with eightpeople in one room said:This situation affects your mental condition when you come together with people like you…we are enclosed in the same room, people who share the same grief, who locked up theirhouses and left… This makes your worries three times worse. (Nyura)Despite the kindness of many private hosts who offered IDPs accommodation without charge or withreduced rents, SGBV incidents occurred. For example, one woman received an accommodation offerfrom men targeting women of specific age groups, while another reported being offeredaccommodation in Lviv in exchange for sex.Having personal space contributes to survival and healing from SGBV. Though often impossible tocreate separate rooms, some measures were put in place in shelters to mitigate loud noises andpossible conflicts. For instance, a shelter in Chernivtsi introduced measures such as prohibiting alcoholindoors. In shelters, female IDPs used various active coping tactics including sharing cleaning, cookingand childcare to help manage stress.Responses to SGBV in internal displacementIn Ukraine, multiple international and local organisations work on SGBV-related issues but domesticviolence (DV) and exploitation of IDPs in the labour market remain overlooked. The number of conflict-affected people in need exceeded the capacities of staff from civil society organisations and localinstitutions whose staff were themselves often having to cope with personal displacement and loss.The shelter in Chernivtsi designed for 30 women who had experienced SGBV was hosting over 300people. The state welfare system in Ukraine was unprepared for the massive scale of internaldisplacement and the welfare payments system was initially chaotic and could not reach everyone inneed. Risk of exploitation and human trafficking of IDPs increased as people were desperately lookingfor work in unfamiliar locations and under stress.Some organisations working on SGBV had to relocate to safer areas and some lost a significantnumber of volunteers and staff because of displacement. Financially, the first half of 2022 wasextremely challenging as some donors left or suspended funding while new donors conducted time-consuming needs assessments. However, some donors that were funding Ukrainian NGOs before 2022allowed the NGOs to redirect funds towards humanitarian needs, expanding their eligibility criteria toinclude distributing material aid to victims of violence and evacuating existing SGBV shelters out of20/06/2024, 00:56Page 3 of 7"
"conflict zones.From late 2022 to early 2023, many donors started focusing specifically on helping victims of SGBV.While this has been a great opportunity to help the State address what had previously been anunderfunded and deprioritised sector, a rapidly increased pool of SGBV providers can negatively impactthe effectiveness of services offered. Firstly, new initiatives can duplicate services, which can lead tocompetition over clients. Secondly, most donors have low or non-existent requirements governingSGBV service provision. Poor quality services can be particularly harmful to DV victims and canundermine their safety. For example, unqualified personnel with poor skills and processes relating toconfidentiality and information management can put survivors at risk and generate distrust in serviceproviders. Some highly distressed victims mentioned that a psychologist recommended they drinkcamomile tea while offering no sustained support. Thirdly, while CRSV receives attention, DV is oftensidelined; DV must be recognised as it often intersects with displacement, post-traumatic stress andbroader war impacts.Way forward: SGBV prevention and responseInter-sectoral capacities and coordination need to be strengthened to mainstream the protection ofIDPs from SGBV. Our recommendations are based on discussions with IDPs and stakeholders inUkraine and on analysis of current policies and practices.Training for service providers:Service providers (including social welfare, health care and police) need to be trained to embed gender-and trauma-sensitive approaches in their daily practices. They need to screen their clients for specificprotection concerns and medical needs that result from SGBV, and develop referral pathways. Acertification system for professionals offering mental health and SGBV support should be developedand the quality of existing SGBV services should be assessed.Mitigating SGBV risks in transit:Verification of private drivers and tracking of the journeys and safe arrivals of IDPs should be put inplace to mitigate SGBV risks in transit.Raising awareness among IDPs:Raising awareness among IDPs about SGBV in general and rape in war as a war crime is important tohelp survivors access their rights. Continued work on DV prevention should draw on the IstanbulConvention (on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence), and newSGBV service providers should ensure that their work supports the implementation of the Conventionand the inclusion of much needed DV services.Reducing SGBV risks in accommodation:Longer-term, sex-segregated accommodation facilities and centralised coordination of private hosts20/06/2024, 00:56Page 4 of 7"
"would ensure that women are not housed with unfamiliar male private hosts. The rental market shouldbe regulated, rental costs subsidised for the most vulnerable groups and private landlords encouragedto rent to women with children who are on minimal pay. Such regulations would enable women to rentprivately and avoid dependency on private hosts with the accompanying risks of exploitation.Creating economic independence:Childcare arrangements are key to allowing parents to make a living. Female-headed IDP householdsshould be supported to register children in pre-school childcare to enable them to work outside thehome.Mental health support:Mental health impacts can increase SGBV vulnerability. Free voluntary mental health screening shouldbe provided, with referrals to mental health professionals trained to work with SGBV survivors and wartrauma.Coordinated funding:Funders should consider supporting flexible services for mobile, newly arrived and returningpopulations, and develop protection programmes and infrastructure to cater for the specific needs ofIDPs and returnees.

Executive Summary 
"Since the start of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine in 2014, there have been countless "
reports of conflict -related sexual violence (CRSV) committed by the Russian forces against 
Ukrainian civilians of all ages and genders. Women in particular have f aced extensive sexual 
"violence during this conflict; they have reported being gang raped, having their families be forced "
"to watch Russians raping them, being branded by soldiers after their rapes, being held as sexual "
"slaves, and being raped until they are pregnant – all of which act as a deliberate method to subjugate "
"the survivors and further break down societal norms and bonds. The international community must react swiftly , and the response must be survivor-oriented toward justice.  "
"Similar to Ukraine, in Bosnia -Herzegovina"
"1 people of all ages, genders, and sexual orientations "
"were subjected to extensive CRSV , and many of the survivors still have not received justice. The "
international community must learn from Bosnia to better prepare its response to Ukraine and to aid trauma -informed social reconstruction postwar so that it does not take 30- plus years for 
survivors to come forward and for communities to heal. This report provides a roadmap for the 
"international community, Ukraine, and the United States to ensure that Ukrainian CRSV survivors are met with survivor- centered reparative justice in a timely manner.   "
Recommendations  
For the International Community 
1.Universal jurisdiction provides recourse for victims and survivors that extends far beyond
"the reach of national courts, which are often backlogged and politicized. States should usethe principle of universal jurisdiction and their own national laws and court systems to"
bring perpetrators of CRSV to justice on behalf of Ukraine.
"2.The international community needs to band together under the legal umbrella of the 1948Genocide Convention to prevent more genocidal acts from occurring, such as the forcible"
transfer of Ukrainian  children to Russia.
"3.A thorough inclusion of the Women, Peace , and Security a genda and conceptions of"
"feminist peace must be present during all considerations of peace between Russia andUkraine in the future. During any future peace talks, women and survivors of CRSV must"
be meaningfully included.
"4.There are numerous resources for survivor -centered CRSV responses, notably the"
"Guidebook on State Obligations for Conflict -Related Sexual Violence, which the"
international community should be using to mitigate and respond to sexual violence in thisconflict.
5.The international Register of Damages must work to incorporate victims’ and survivors ’
inputs and ideas when creating a compensation plan.
"6.As with all responses to the conflict, a survivor -centered approach is necessary for holistic,"
"restorative, and positive peace."
"1 Henceforth, the authors refer to  “Bosnia -Herzegovina ” as “Bosnia. ” "
  
 
   
 2 
For Ukraine  
1. The creation of a domestic registry of l osses and damages can ease restrictions to access 
for survivors and complement the international R egister  of D amages . 
2. Victim- oriented reparations need to be part of the ongoing discussion of state -centered 
reparations. The reparations also must go beyond strictly financial considerations and 
"should include assistance like legal counseling, psychosocial support, and health care.  "
3. Survivors must be provided with free legal aid so they are not further bearing the cost of seeking justice.  
"4. The Ukrainian Parliament should pass the proposed bill by the Committee on Law Enforcement Activities  that addresses the limitation for the pretrial investigation, regarding "
the Criminal Procedure Code of Ukraine on Improving the Procedure for Conducting Pretrial Investigations and Trials in Criminal Proceedings Regarding Crimes Related to 
Sexual Violence Commi tted in Conditions of Armed Conflict.  
5. National investigations and documentation of CRSV crimes should align with the standards laid out in the International Protocol on the Documentation and Investigation of 
Sexual Violence in Conflict.  
"6. If Russia succeeds in its illegal occupation and annexation of parts of Ukraine, the rights of Ukrainian victims in these areas could be jeopardized. The Ukrainian government should "
look at the barriers placed on accountability and justice in Bosnia and begin to prepare how 
to move toward justice with this in mind . 
"7. Ukraine should move to put legal protections in place for children born of wartime rape. Bosnia’s legislation, which recognizes children born of wartime rape, is groundbreaking; "
Ukraine should not wait 30 years to enact such important legal measures.  
8. Ukraine must not shy away from investigating and prosecuting Ukra inians who committed 
war crimes against their own people or against those aligned with Russia during the 
conflict.  
9. Psychosocial support must be made available holistically and sustainably to survivors of 
"CRSV , and it is critical to ensure that all victims of CRSV, including men, those with "
"diverse SOGIESC  (sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions, and sex "
"characteristics),  and other groups are supported. "
10. The use of technology should be considered to help CRSV survivors in court proceedings through mechanisms such as face filtering or voice alterations during testimony. 
For the United States  
1. The U.S. government should use its immense intelligence resources to ensure the Presidential Memorandum on Accountability for CRSV is being used to the fullest extent 
in order to designate sanctions for perpetrators of CRSV in Ukraine. 
2. Congress should work to strengthen U.S. laws on atrocity crimes by enacting legislation to prevent and punish crimes against humanity (CAHs) to fill the loopholes that allow for the 
U.S. to be a “safe haven” for perpetrators of CAHs.

Foreword  
Gender -based crimes like sexual violence are too often ignored or swept under the carpet during 
"and post- conflict, so survivors of conflict -related sexual violence (CRSV) rarely see justice or "
"accountability for themselves. We saw this in Bosnia, where women were excluded from the peace "
process and survivors of CRSV are still struggling to receive recognition and reparation to this 
day.  
This is a project of the New Lines Institute that seeks to learn from the past in Bosnia in order to 
provide a better future for survivors of CRSV in Ukraine. It has been three decades since the 
"Bosnian war, and yet still so many survivors of CRSV in Bosnia are waiting for reparative justice. "
It is incumbent upon Ukraine’s allies to do everything in our power to find justice and 
accountability for survivors of sexual violence  in Ukraine. Without a holistic approach to 
"addressing the needs of CRSV survivors, justice will most likely remain out of reach.  "
"The report provides actionable recommendations for the i nternational community, Ukraine, and "
the United States to support survivors of CRSV in this war and to ensure that actions taken on their 
"behalf are survivor -centered and trauma- informed, including: creating a domestic registry of losses "
and damages to complement the international Register of Damages; putting in place legal 
protections for children born of wartime rape; providing psychosocial support to all survivors; 
using the United States’ Presidential Memorandum on Accountability for CRSV to the fullest 
extent to designate sanctions for perpetrators of CRSV in Ukraine; and much more. 
We believe the recommendations laid out in this report will provide a toolkit for policymakers 
around the globe to champion the rights of survivors of CRSV and assist in the social 
reconstruction of Ukraine. The case of Bosnia provides a blueprint for Ukraine and the 
international community with respect to the needs of survivors of CRSV – an experience that will remain with them for the rest of their lives. These factors will shape the rebuilding of Ukraine and 
its long -term recovery as a country in the aftermath of war. It is our hope that this report can 
provide direction toward the overarching goal of justice and accountability for all survivors of 
CRSV in the Ukraine war.

Introduction  
The Bosnian w ar (1992- 1995) is well -known for the targeted and systematic use of rape and sexual 
"violence against civilian populations, which were used as part of a larger campaign of genocide. "
"Serb forces set up rape camps to forcibly impregnate Bosniak women, forcing them to carry to "
"term children who would be viewed as Serbian.2 It is estimated that 20,000 to 50,000 women were "
raped during the war led by Slobodan Milosevic and the Bosnian Serb political and military 
"leadership, which resulted in an estimated 2,000 to 4,000 children born of wartime rape.3 This is "
"a critical component of the Bosnian genocide campaign, as illustrated by comments from Serb "
soldiers that “it is better to give birth to Chetniks than to Muslim filth.”4 Although many of these 
"gender- based crimes have been thoroughly documented over the past three decades, efforts for "
"justice, accountability, and healing for the victims and survivors have been sparse. In the case of Bosnia, landmark international legal jurisprudence was generated through the bravery of women "
survivors who testified before the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia 
"(ICTY) , resulting in the convictions of 32 individuals as of September 2016."
"5 Nonetheless, men, "
"women, boys, girls , and individuals with diverse gender identities are still living with their trauma,6 "
often forced to live literally right next door to their abusers and to see them every day. Children 
"born of rape are stigmatized in a society that has been divided along ethnic lines,7 essentially "
continuing the genocide denial that remains present in political discourse espoused by Serbian 
leaders in Bosnia and Serbia and their supporters.8 Male rape victims have only recently begun to 
come forward to speak about the trauma and sexual abuse they faced in detention centers.9 One 
"male survivor, describing his assault and trauma, said: “You carry it inside you, like a bomb.”10 "
"Both Bosnia and Ukraine are patriarchal Slavic countries where men dominate public spaces and rigid gender norms are strictly enforced and maintained in society. This culture, rooted in "
"hegemonic masculinity and patriarchal norms, is in part why men are reluctant to speak publicly "
"about the gender -based violence they suffered. As a result, Bosnian men who survived CRSV have "
"been unable to access the help they need or attain justice and reparations, even decades later. It is the responsibility of both the international community and the Ukrainian government to ensure a "
similar situation does not play out in Ukraine.

Experts have concluded that traumatized survivors as well as those who have sustained chronic 
"medical conditions as a consequence of sexual violence require continuous, personalized "
"psychosocial care. While most survivors will never obtain justice, the Global Survivors Fund "
(GSF) has advanced the principle of reparations as a right for all survivors of CRSV.11 With respect 
"to Bosnia, the state has failed to uphold international standards on accessibility to reparations, which should act as a cautionary tale for Ukraine."
12 As has been m ade obvious in public statements 
"by the International Criminal Court ( ICC) prosecutor and U .N. officials,13 a key component of "
Russia’s genocidal campaign in Ukraine is the targeted and systematic use of sexual and gender -
"based violence against civilians, much like Serb forces’ actions in the Bosnian w ar. The Ukrainian  "
government declared during the earliest days of the Russian invasion that rape by Russian soldiers 
was widespread and systematic.14 Russian soldiers are raping children in front of their parents and 
"vice versa,15 forcing couples to have sex with each other in front of soldiers, and using sexual "
"violence as a way to break familial bonds, destroy communities, and sow terror so as to remove "
Ukrainians from their land.16  
"It has been 30 years since the Bosnian w ar broke out , and untold numbers of survivors are still "
"struggling daily to reconstruct their lives. However, for Ukraine, there is time to act now in order to better prepare those who are dealing with, and responding to, similar crimes. The international "
community must learn from Bosnia to better prepare its response to Ukraine and to aid trauma -
informed social reconstruction postwar so that it does not take 30- plus years for survivors to come 
forward and for communities to heal. 
Conflict -Related Sexual Violence in the Ukraine War  
"Since the start of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine in 2014, there have been countless "
reports of CRSV committed by the Russian forces against Ukrainian civilians of all ages and 
"genders. There are reports of CRSV perpetrated by the Ukrainian armed forces  as well , particularly "
"before 2021, but such reports are rare.17 According to a report by the Independent International "
"Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine published in October 2022, CRSV carried out by Russia in "
Ukraine is being used as a tactic and a weapon of war; the report details extensive sexual violence

"against men, women, children, and the elderly.18 The sexual violence being carried out by the "
"Russian Army, Russian- affiliated forces, and Russian -led separatists encompasses all forms of "
"CRSV, which includes, but is not limited to: “ rape, sexual slavery, forced prostitution, forced "
"pregnancy, forced abortion, forced sterilization, forced marriage, and any other form of sexual "
violence of comparable gravity. ”19   
Feminist scholars have long written about why and how armed forces use rape during war. One important component of rape as a weapon of war is the sense of social cohesion and bonding that 
rape provides for militaries that are not cohesive or have used forc e to recruit their fighters.
20 The 
"Russian military relies heavily on conscripts, forced recruitment, foreign fighters, and mercenaries who do not have a strong sense of belief in the cause of the invasion. These groups have a higher "
likelihood of participating in sexual violence during conflict.
"21 Gang rape , in particular , creates "
bonds of cohesion among soldiers who do not have a shared background or the same allegiance toward an ongoing war. Group cohesion has been shown to increase with the performative aspects 
of group gang rape through participatory actions such as watching one another perform and 
through social pressure to engage.
22 Gang rape has been documented in Ukraine against civilians 
"by Russian troops. Based on research across 86 conflicts between 1980 and 2009, there is evidence "
to suggest that the ongoing use of gang rape by Russian- affiliated troops against Ukrainian citizens 
is providing similar group cohesion among potentially disinterested troops.23 
CRSV has been used consistently by Russian forces as part of a systematic campaign of atrocities 
"against the Ukrainian people, but statistically, the chances for legal accountability are slim: Since "
the establishment of the ICTY and ICTR (International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda) in the 
"1990s, fewer than 100 charges have been brought against perpetrators of CRSV crimes , and less "
"than half of those have ended in convictions of sexual violence in relation to genocide, crimes against humanity, or war crimes."
"24 Despite these numbers, the opportunity for legal accountability "

in Ukraine is much higher than in many other conflict situations due to the concerted efforts of the 
international community and the Ukrainian government. The Independent International 
Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine indicated that victims of sexual violence in this war range from 
ages 4 to 80.25 The sexual violence being carried out against women in Ukraine has been rampant 
and not limited to the period since the beginning of 2022; soldiers have committed mass rape against Ukrainian women and girls since 2014. Women have reported being gang raped both in 
"their homes and after being detained, having their families be forced to watch Russians raping "
"them, being branded by soldiers after their rapes, being held as sexual slaves, being raped until "
"they are pregnant, and many other cases."
26 The incorporation of family members into instances of 
rape and gang rape is a deliberate method to subjugate the survivors and further break down 
societal norms and bonds.27  
"Men have similarly been victims of CRSV in Ukraine. Typically, cases of CRSV perpetrated against men are underreported, yet studies show that CRSV against men takes place in almost "
every conflict.
"28 There are a variety of reasons for this underreporting, including: the "
incompatibility with the perceived victimhood of sexual violence and a culture’s understanding of masculinity
29; the fact that sexual violence against men is typically coded as torture30; the lack of 
adequate understanding and training of medical workers and/or humanitarian workers on what 
male CRSV looks like; and men being potentially dissuaded from reporting.31  
It is important to distinguish the typology of sexual abuses perpetrated against men and to point 
"out some of the gendered harms that men experience , so as not to further perpetuate the stereotype "
that only women and girls are victims of CRSV. T he use of detention has been a core feature of 
"the acts of sexual violence committed against people of all genders in Ukraine, with men being "
"particularly at risk of sexual violence in detention centers.32 Within detention centers, enemy "
"combatants sexually assault and torture men of all ages with weapons like batons, wooden sticks, and pipes."
33 The U.S. Department of State indicated that sexual torture was used to try to elicit 
"confessions from both men and women: “Beatings and electric shock in the genital area, rape, "

"threats of rape, forced nudity, and threats of rape against family members were used as a method "
"of torture and mistreatment to punish, humiliate, or extract confessions.”34 Prior to the 2022 "
"invasion, men comprised 85% of detainees in eastern Ukraine.35 While detention centers were "
"certainly hotbeds for CRSV, other contexts for sexual violence included checkpoints and areas "
"with a heightened military presence. Because of this, survivors of CRSV in detention centers from "
"before the 2022 war are more likely to be younger men, while survivors of CRSV outside of "
detention are overwhelmingly women.36 
Ukrainian children have not been spared from the horrors of CRSV in this war. There have been numerous confirmed cases of children being illegally detained and confined by Russian forces in 
"Ukraine. In one instance, upward of 70 children, the youngest of whom was only 6 weeks old, "
"were detained along with approximately 400 civilians for 28 days in a school basement in Yahidne, "
in Chernihiv Oblast .
37 There has been limited confirmation about sexual violence perpetrated 
"against children in this conflict, but there are cases confirmed, and it is likely that the rates are "
much higher than what is officially documented: Almost 80% of cases of sexual violence in 
"conflict go unreported, and this number is only exacerbated in cases involving children.38 "
"According to the Office of the Prosecutor General (OPG) in Ukraine, as of July 13, 2023, prosecutors have recorded 13 cases of CRSV against children. A UNHCR commission "
"documented occurrences of Russian forces raping girls after entering their homes, and of forcing "
young children to listen to their mothers being raped.
39  
"In addition to the CRSV that children have experienced, the kidnapping, theft, and trafficking of children is immensely concerning. Russia has removed upward of 20,000 children from Ukraine, "
forcibly displacing them to Russian- occupied parts of Ukraine or to orphanages and group homes 
"in Russia. Once the Ukrainian children are in Russia, they are put up for adoption so Russian families can strip them of their Ukrainian identity, nationality, and culture."
40 While this act alone 
"may amount to genocide ,41 there is also no oversight on the safety and security of these Ukrainian "
"children, so little is known about whether they are also being sexually abused throughout this "
ordeal.

"Conflict -Related Sexual Violence in the Bosnian War, 1992 -1995:  "
What Can We Learn for Ukraine?  
"Women, men, and children (overwhelmingly Bosniak Muslim s) were targeted for CRSV during "
"the Bosnian war. While many of these CRSV survivors have still not received justice, the tribunal’s "
"work was nonetheless significant, albeit limited, in terms of providing justice for survivors. In "
"total, the ICTY accused 16 1 individuals of crimes of sexual violence , including sexual assault and "
rape. The court ultimately charg ed 78 individuals but convicted only 32 of them. While t he ICTY  
"produced historic international jurisprudence with respect to CRSV , this also showcases how "
incredibly difficult and rare these types of prosecutions have been.42 It will be important for 
prosecutors and investigators examining atrocity crimes in the context of Ukraine to pay attention 
"to gender -based crimes and establish these links when necessary , not only to strengthen their cases "
but also to ensure that all victims and survivors are acknowledged. 
"Nationally, despite a strong judicial infrastructure and considerable ground covered in prosecuting "
"a significant number of war crimes cases in Bosnia, nearly 500 war crimes cases involving more "
"than 4,000 known suspects remain on backlog for prosecutors to adjudicate as of 2022.43 "
"Significant inconsistencies in sentencing, including lenient punishments and blatant corruption, have been documented by Trial International,"
"44 OSCE,45 and the Council of Europe.46 One of the "
"most egregious practices allowed by Bosnian courts is for convicted defendants to buy out their prison sentence by paying a fine. In the past five years, eight individuals sentenced for war crimes "
avoided  serving prison time by paying this fine.
"47 Between 2012 and 2017, for those who did serve "
"their sentences, sentences for CRSV cases averaged less than five years  – below the statutory "
minimum laid out in the Criminal Code of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.48 As 
"Ukraine investigates war crimes on its own soil, it will be incumbent on its courts to prevent "
"corruption that could get in the way of justice being served, especially for cases involving CRSV. "
One of the most significant lessons Ukraine can take from the Bosnian war is to rely on the 
expertise of local NGOs and civil society organizations when working on the issue of CRSV. 
NGOs played an important role in providing psychosocial support and assisting with reparations

"claims for survivors of CRSV in Bosnia, especially Medica Zenica, which was established in the "
midst of the war. Ukraine must rely upon local and national NGOs during and post -conflict to 
provide holistic care and support to all survivors of CRSV. 
Ukraine: Social Reconstruction and  
International Justice and Accountability Processes  
"Since 2014, there have been many different avenues, both national and international, toward justice and reparations for survivors of CRSV in eastern Ukraine. Victims and survivors have been  "
"impacted physically, psychologically, economically, and socially, and they have specific needs "
and recommendations on how and why both material and symbolic reparations are crucial to their 
justice and accountability process. This is extensively detailed in the GSF Global Reparations 
"Study on Ukraine,"
"49 with survivors asking for reparative measures such as special victim status, "
"public recognition and acknowledgment from the Ukrainian government, free legal aid, restitution of housing and property, restoration of personal documents, guarantees of nonrepetition, and "
"compensation for lost housing, rehabilitation services, psychological support, and childcare. Most "
"survivors believe it is the responsibility of the Ukrainian government, with international support, "
to provide reparations  – although the final bill should go to Russia. Though there has been some 
"movement on transitional justice mechanisms, progress is slow, which raises the difficult question of how to address transitional justice in a timely manner while being thorough and c entering "
survivors’ voices and needs.  
"According to Ukraine’s Conflict -Related Sexual Violence Crimes Department, led by Iryna "
"Didenko in the OPG (as of July 13, 2023), prosecutors have recorded 212 cases of CRSV (69 men  "
"and 143 women, including minors, who comprise 12 girls and one boy). These cases include rape, "
"genital mutilation, forced exposure, and forcing individuals to watch the sexual abuse of loved "
"ones. In 62 of the 212 cases, the OPG was able to identify 30 Russian Federation servicemen who "
"committed wartime rape and sexual violence.  All 30 men have been indicted, and two have been "
"formally convicted in absentia and sentenced to 12 and 10 years, respectively. It is a testament to the dedication of Didenko’s team that they have been able to investigate and identify Russian "
soldiers for CRSV in the midst of war.  
The number of male CRSV victims who are soldiers in Ukraine’s Armed Forces – men who were 
"held captive and subjected to torture, rape, and genital mutilation with electric current – is "
"increasing. These men must be included in any conversations about accountability for CRSV. After the de -occupation of territories in the e ast and s outh of Ukraine, there emerged a clear pattern: "
"Wherever the Russian military was stationed, Russian forces used sexual violence to subdue "
"communities and break family and community bonds – a hallmark of genocide , as previously "

"Regarding individual criminal accountability, universal jurisdiction is gaining traction "
"internationally , and it appears more likely that third states that may be signatories of the Rome  "
Statute  might support the prosecution of Russian war criminals within domestic courts. A recent 
example of such a prosecution took place in a German court that handed down a genocide 
conviction of an Islamic State fighter who had sexually assaulted and enslaved a Yazidi woman in 
"Syria.51 There has also been a concerted effort to freeze and seize Russian assets, both public and "
"private, in W estern countries. In March 2022, the European Commission created the “ Freeze and "
Seize” Task Force to ensure EU member states’ cooperation and collaboration on sanctions related 
"to Ukraine. As of November 2022, EU m ember states had frozen 19 billion euros (around $20.9 "
"billion U.S.  at current rates ) of Russian oligarchs’  assets.52 Additionally, nearly 300 billion euros  "
of Russian Central Bank reserves have been immobilized in the EU and other G7 countries. The 
"Commission has proposed 1) to set up a system to manage and invest frozen public funds, and to "
"use the revenue to rebuild Ukraine , and 2) to link Central Bank assets to a possible future peace "
"agreement, which would compensate Ukraine for damages suffered. In October 2022, the New Lines Institute convened a team of international legal experts, economists, and scholars to devise "
a new  means of reparations through its Multilateral Action Model on Reparations (MAMOR):
53 
"“The MAMOR provides a roadmap for lawfully using Russian funds already frozen by the countries that have sanctioned Russia for its war and provides a detailed, actionable list of possible "
"sources of Russian state funds for use. It also establishes a funct ional, efficient means of collecting "
"and distributing those funds, so that they might be used to rebuild Ukraine not in the distant future, but as the war continues.” In June 2023, New Lines released another report outlining a m ultilateral "
asset transfer scheme that proposes that countries can legally go beyond just freezing Russian 
assets and actually transfer the 3 00 billion  euros in assets to be held in escrow for the reconstruction 
of Ukraine.
54 The law of countermeasures in international law entitles s tates to respond in such a 
way. This unique model would allow for the creation of a global fund for reconstruction and 
reparations that could begin as early as this year. 
The United States has been leading efforts to provide material support to Ukraine as well as 
"devising accountability measures, especially for survivors of CRSV. In  April 2023, USAID, with "
"the help of the U.N. Population Fund, donated  60 vehicles to the Ukrainian government and local "
partners to assist the 100 mobile teams that  currently provide free psychosocial support to 
survivors of gender -based violence and domestic violence across Ukraine.55 These individuals

"often reside in remote areas or near the front lines, which makes gaining access to care difficult. "
"As of April, the teams had responded to more than 90,000 calls, demonstrating the tremendous "
need for these mobile teams and for more support for programs that prioritize the needs of 
"survivors of gender -based violence . In November 2022, President Joe Biden released a Presidential "
Memorandum on Promoting Accountability for CRSV (PM) in conjunction with the United Kingdom’ s international ministerial conference on the Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict  
Initiative .
"56 The PM directs the s ecretary of s tate, the s ecretary of the T reasury, the attorney "
"general, and the director of national intelligence to use “ existing authorities to the fullest extent "
"possible to promote accountability for acts of CRSV ” against people of all genders. In the PM, the "
"U.S. commits to using all available instruments of accountability including sanctions, security "
"assistance, visa restrictions, and bilateral diplomacy with foreign partner governments to advance "
"and advocate for justice and accountability for perpetrators of CRSV. Importantly, the PM also "
directs the federal agencies to work bilaterally and multilaterally with international organizations and local civil society organizations on survivor -centered evidence gathering. Sanctions are very 
"rarely used against those who perpetrate acts of CRSV, so while the PM has only been in implementation mode for less than a year, it is already providing the Treasury Department with a new lens through which to examine and designate sanctions.  "
"While all of these legal methods and plans are important, just as important are plans for the social "
"reconstruction of Ukraine. As we can see from Bosnia, decades have passed and some survivors "
of CRSV are only now coming forward to share their stories and try to access reparations. 
"Transformative reparations – reparations that address structural social, gender, political, and "
economic inequalities – must be created and made accessible to all survivors. While international 
"legal mechanisms can be an important part of transitional justice, they often lack financial support  "
"or actual enforcement, and they can take decades to reach a conclusion. This is why interim "
reparative measures and domestic efforts are critical at this juncture. Local civil society 
organizations and NGOs are best placed  to provide transformative assistance to survivors of 
"CRSV, making it crucial for Ukraine to establish a domestic registry for victims rather than relying "
"solely on an international registry . In addition to individual repar ations, collective reparations "
should be considered. Collective reparations are benefits meant “to undo the collective harm that has been caused as a consequence of a violation of international law.”
57These benefits should 
address the root causes of societal inequalities and could include building schools and hospitals or 
establishing a truth commission to investigate the collective harm the Russian Federation has 
caused Ukrainians.  
"Despite all of  this progress, there remain many barriers in place to achieving justice and "
"accountability for survivors of CRSV. There have  recently been issues with evidence sharing, for "
"example,  as the U.S. Pentagon blocked intelligence on Russian war crimes from being released for "

"several months.58 However, in July 2023, Biden ordered the U.S. government to begin sharing this "
"evidence with the ICC in a quiet but major shift in U.S. policy.59 Another barrier is that, a s detailed "
"above, survivors are often reluctant to come forward for a variety of reasons. There are many "
"psychosocial as well as physical barriers to reporting sexual violence, especially during an armed "
"conflict , including fear of Russian reprisal, systematic sexism in Ukrainian systems, deeply "
"embedded corruption in Ukrainian law enforcement, social stigma and judgment, and fear of being seen as “colluding” with the Russians. One of the biggest challenges to achieving j ustice for this "
"war, however, is the lack of coordination. There are  many disparate and disconnected efforts in "
"Ukraine to gather and document evidence of atrocity crimes, to interview witnesses and survivors, "
"and to create and set up tribunals, yet many of these efforts remain siloed. Without both evidence "
"and victim or witness statements, it will be impossible to secure reparative justice for survivors. As Ukraine moves forward, it will be important to look to Bosnia to learn what worked and what didn’t in order to most effectively serve Ukrainian survivors of CRSV.  "
Lessons Learned /Policy Options 
For the International Community  
"1. Universal Jurisdiction : In 2018, 23 years after the conclusion of the Bosnian war, a "
positive development occurred in war crimes prosecutions when Bosnia indicted former 
Bosnian Serb soldier Slobodan Ćurčić for the murder of two Bosniaks and the rape and 
"sexual abuse of Bosniak women and girls in the municipality of Foč a. In 2022, the Higher "
"Court in Podgorica, Montenegro, confirmed an indictment of Ćurčić, who was living in "
"Montenegro at the time . The Montenegrin court’s action marks a milestone , as it is one of "
"the first war crimes cases transferred from Bosnia to Montenegro, exemplifying how "
"universal jurisdiction must be respected and enforced, especially within the Western "
"Balkans. Like the Yazidi case in Germany and now this case in Montenegro, universal "
jurisdiction is an option for third countries to do their duty under international law. 
Thousands of Bosnian victims are unlikely to obtain justice during their lifetimes. Given 
"the backlog of the war crimes cases, some perpetrators are not within Bosnia’s reach, and "
"many are quite old and ill , yielding to impairment and/or death. In the case of Ukraine, "
states have a logical and moral duty to use the principle of universal jurisdiction and their 
own national laws and court systems to bring perpetrators of CRSV to justice on behalf of 
"Ukraine. Countries including Lithuania, Germany, Sweden, and Spain have a ll already "
"opened investigations into Russian war crimes in Ukraine. More countries should follow suit and assist Ukraine’s OPG with its investigations into 80,000- plus war crimes.  "
"2. The Genocide Convention : Under the Genocide Convention, s tate parties must act to "
"prevent genocide per Article I at the moment they know, or reasonably should have known, "
"that there is a serious risk of genocide , and to punish substantive breaches of the Genocide "
"Convention as stipulated in Article III. In May 2022, the New Lines Institute and the Raoul Wallenberg Center published a legal analysis that detailed the Russian Federation’s "

"breaches of the Genocide Convention.60 Over a year later, evidence continues to show that "
Russia is engaging in a systematic and targeted campaign of genocide against the Ukrainian 
people and that it bears state responsibility for commission of this crime. The Genocide 
"Convention provides a vehicle for s tate parties to act. For example, s tates with stronger "
"political links to Russia have a greater duty to use their influence in this regard, while other "
states can send more military supplies and weapons to Ukraine to prevent the  humanitarian 
"crisis from worsening . In March 2023, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Russian "
President Vladimir Putin and his Commissioner for Children’s Rights Maria Lvova -Belova 
for the war crimes of abduction and deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia. In addition 
"to war crimes under the Rome Statute, provisions of the 1948 Genocide Convention also "
provide a vehicle for justice for the  above acts. While these acts are currently categorized 
"as war crimes by the ICC ,61 the arrest warrants also put s tate parties to the Genocide "
"Convention on notice that potential genocidal acts could be occurring,62 thus triggering the "
"duty to prevent. Any of the 152 s tate parties ,63 not least the half -dozen or so countries "
"whose parliaments have determined genocide is taking place, should immediately take "
"action to the best of their ability to prevent more genocidal acts from occurring, especially "
"by these individuals who have ordered, and are instrumental in, the forcible transfer  of "
"Ukrainian children to Russia, among other crimes. "
3. The International Criminal Court : Regarding t he ICC’s arrest warrant for Vlad imir 
"Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, members of the international community should cooperate "
with the ICC  in the execution of its  arrest warrant s and  investigate and supply information 
to the C ourt on the role of other Russian and Belarusian officials in unlawfully deporting 
Ukrainian childre n. It is important for the C ourt to issue arrest warrant s for other key 
officials of the Russian regime  who are ordering and engaging in such war crimes.  
"4. Women, Peace , and Security Agenda and Feminist Peace Processes : In Bosnia, "
challenges remain around genocide denial and a dysfunctioning Council of Ministers due 
"to obstruction from within the national government, which has had a detrimental effect on "
rule of law and human rights nationally. The Dayton Agreement’s construction of multiple 
governments64 that were purposefully decentralized has had the effect of weakening the 
"state of Bosnia-Herzegovina and undermining human rights throughout the country, "
"especially with respect to reparations for CRSV or torture victims , who have neither "
standard benefits across the country nor systematic support due to the vast differences 
between governments from the state to the local level s.65 This government construction 
"highlights how valuable it is to have community- driven, inclusive, and feminist peace "

"64 The Dayton Agreement ended the Bosnian war, confirmed Bosnia’ s independence, and divided the country into the Bosniak -Croat Federation "

froze rather than ended the conflict.

processes integrated into any peace discussions between Russia and Ukraine in the future. 
The dysfunctional post -Dayton states are an example of “war by other means” through the 
"obstruction of government, lack of rule of law, and lack of prosecution for some of the war’s most violent offenders. There is much to be learned about how important holistic and "
inclusive peace is not just for lasting peace but also for retributive justice for CRSV 
survivors. The Dayton Agreement was silent not only on women’s effective or meaningful 
"participation in the peace process, but also on survivors’ participation. Instead, the peace "
talks excluded both groups and focused solely on issues of ethnicity and territory. Inclusive peace and transitional justice processes where women have a meaningful seat at the table 
are more likely to result in  a longer- lasting and more durable peace.
"66 Furthermore, by "
excluding survivors from meaningful participation in the peace talks and ignoring the prevalence of CRSV and the gendered manner in which Serb forces waged their war in 
"Bosnia, often using women’s bodies as a battlefield, the peace negotia tors missed a key "
"opportunity to address some of the root causes of the war. Perhaps if women and survivors had been meaningfully included in the Dayton peace process, we would not be seeing "
conflict brewing in the Western Balkans once again. If and when a  peace process for 
"Ukraine is conducted, women and survivors must be included effectively as equal and "
meaningful participants.  
5. Framework of Cooperation:  One of the most significant lessons the international 
community as a whole learned from Bosnia was the need for a more specialized focus on 
how to prevent and respond to conflict -related sexual violence. The U.N. in particular 
realized the need to create t he Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary -General 
"on Sexual Violence in Conflict (OSRSG -SVC), which is currently led by Pramila Patten. "
"This office was established in 2009 to change the view that CRSV is an “inevitable byproduct of war, but  rather a crime that is preventable and punishable under International "
Human Rights Law and International Criminal Law.”
67 Since Russia’s illegal invasion of 
"Ukraine in February 2022, the OSRSG -SVC has been working diligently to support the "
"Ukrainian government in assisting survivors of CRSV and strengthening accountability mechanisms for perpetrators. In May 2022, the  Framework of Cooperation between the "
"government of Ukraine and Pramila Patten’s office was signed, which brings together "
international and national actors in support of survivors of CRSV.
"68 Importantly, the "
"Framework also builds upon Ukraine’s National Action Plan for Women, Peace and "
"Security  (WPS) , a key agenda to be used for any feminist or holistic response to conflict. "
Ukraine’s allies should coordinate with the OSRSG -SVC on the Framework of 
Cooperation’s priorities and provide financial support to the Ukrainian government for the 
implementation  of Ukraine’s National Action Plan  on WPS.

Obligations for Conflict- Related Sexual Violence” that “compiles all of the applicable 
international law and norms relating to conflict- related sexual violence into a handbook 
with an aim to inform States in a comprehensive manner of their current obligations under 
"international humanitarian law, international human rights law, and UN Security Council "
"resolutions that form the Women, Peace and Security agenda.”69 There already exist a "
plethora of laws and international obligations relating to accountability for CRSV. Ukraine 
and its allies should use the full extent of the law not only to punish perpetrators of CRSV 
but also to prevent it from happening in the firs t place. The Guidebook is a resource for 
policymakers to see all of the relevant international norms and standards in one place for 
"the first time ever and, importantly, it employed a survivor -centered approach in the "
drafting process. 
"7. International Register of Damages : In May 2023, the Council of Europe approved a "
"Register of Damages to document Russian damages against Ukraine from Feb. 24, 2022, "
onward for future compensation and reparation claims.70 The register was created for an 
initial period of three years. Although this is a positive step to pursue justice and 
"accountability beyond criminal prosecution measures, the register is a national and "
"international policy response to the war, created without consultation with the victims "
themselves. The resolution that established the international register does not provide 
instructions for how to prioritize claims or what forms of compensation or reparation may 
"be offered. The main office for the registry will be located in The Hague, far away from "
potential claimants in Ukraine. The New Lines Institute’s m ultilateral asset transfer 
"proposal (discussed above) should be used to fund the international register as well as a domestic register (discussed below) , with specific guidance for survivors of CRSV. The "
implementers of the international register must create a plan with input from victims for how compensation can be allocated.  
8. Survivor- C
" entered Approach : Justice delayed is justice denied, but top- down justice "
without input from survivors themselves is not really justice at all. The implementers of 
the international register and the proposed domestic register (see below) should work with 
local NGOs and Iry na Didenko’s office in Ukraine’s OPG to listen to what survivors have 
"to say  and their needs for reparation, including but not limited to compensation, and "
develop solutions together that address the needs of all survivors of CRSV. A survivor -
"centered approach must be integrated into the registers for losses and damages, interim reparative measures, all reparations programs, the humanitarian response, collecting and "
"gathering of evidence and testimonies for legal procedures, and a ny Ukrainian state service "
"providers and structures working with survivors of CRSV. In Bosnia, organizations like Medica Zenica and Vive Zene were critical to justice and accountability efforts for "
survivors of sexual violence and torture during and after the war due to their deep 
"knowledge of the issues and preexisting connections in the local communities. Funding, "

"effective, sustainable, and inclusive. "
For Ukraine  
"1. Domestic Registry of Losses and Damages:  I n Ukraine, there appears to be too much "
reliance on what the international Register of Damages will do for survivors of CRSV. A 
domestic registry and domestic reparations process will fill the gaps in  the international 
mechanism. It is important for Ukraine to set up a domestic registry to complement and coordinate with the international mechanism. Under the Office of the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights’ Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and 
Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and 
"Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law, the standard of proof for reparation "
purposes is lower than beyond a reasonable doubt.
"76 If necessary, the domestic registry can "
have different evidentiary requirements than the international mechanism (while maintaining the same standard of proof) in order to ease restrictions on access for survivors  
of CRSV in particular . The domestic register will also  be far more accessible 
"geographically than the international register, making it easier for survivors and victims’ "
families in Ukraine. Having a domestic register would also help rebuild democratic 
institutions and repair trust in domestic structures and systems. The international and 
domestic registers should coordinate in order  to avoid unnecessary harm to survivors. A 
"domestic registry can be a place where all data can be stored , organized , consolidated, and "
aggregated in some way for transitional justi ce and reparations  (which will require further 
"discussion on how to store the data, security, etc.). Furthermore, the international registry will only cover violations that have occurred since 2022, but the conflict began in 2014, so "
survivors pre -2022 will be excluded from this instrument of justice. An important 
consideration for Ukraine when it comes to registers of damages is the question of funding. 
If the international mechanism and the proposed domestic registry are to be funded by 
"frozen and transfe rred Russian assets, any s tates where the Russian assets are held, like the "
"U.S. and the U.K., will be involved in decisions around where the funds will go. This could possibly be restrictive, so it will be critical for these stakeholders to ensure a survivor -"
centered approach wher e funds are used in a way that fully benefits survivors of CRSV. 
While the New Lines Institute’s multilateral asset transfer proposal can be used to  take 
"frozen Russian assets to  fund both the international and domestic registers, the international "
community and Ukraine should still be encouraged to donate funds to support this work.  
2. Reparations:  While it’s a positive step that the demand for reparations has been on the 
"table since the beginning of the invasion, right now the conversation on reparations for "
Ukraine is state- centered and there is a limited understanding of what individual victim

reparations mean s compared to state reparations. Reparations  are much more than just 
"financial compensation, which is why survivor -centered approaches are critical. The ICC’s "
Trust Fund for Victims77 provides some best practices about the most appropriate forms of 
reparations for victims. It is through the designing and implementation process of 
"acknowledgment, justice and accountability measures, guarantees of nonrepetition, and "
"rehabilitation that h ealing begins for survivors of CRSV. Interim reparative measures, like "
"providing access to health care, psychosocial support, or free legal counseling, should be "
put in place in advance of any formal reparations process. Bosnia does have a domestic 
"reparations program, although its actual implementation is ineffective due to the governing "
"structure of the country, so only about 1,000 people are getting reparations. Ukraine also "
"does have a domestic reparations program, but unfortunately there has been limit ed "
"government assistance for survivors of CRSV from 2014 onward. According to the GSF Study on Ukraine, as of December 2021 only 209 survivors had actually received a one -"
time governmental compensation.
"78 The OPG in Ukraine is investigating over 80,000 war "
crimes and the CRSV u nit is investigating hundreds of documented cases  of CRSV . In 
"conflicts around the world, survivors of CRSV have been waiting so long for any form of justice that many are dying as they wait. While survivors of sexual violence have a right to "
"justice and reparations, the reality is that legal mechanisms and prosecutions are rare, costly, and lengthy processes with an unclear deterrent effect for future atrocities."
79 In the 
"meantime, States Parties to the Rome Statute and/or to the Genocide Convention, civil society  organizations , the broader international community, and other relevant actors can "
"take action to support the immediate needs of survivors , such as medical care and shelter. "
We need not wait for prosecutions or t ruth and j ustice  commissions  and/or r econciliation 
commissions to begin addressing the gender -based harms inflicted upon people during 
"conflicts. In fact, the GSF Study on Ukraine found that domestic administrative reparations "
"programs are actually more effective and inclusive than efforts made through nati onal, "
"international, civil, or criminal courts."
80 Interim reparative measures are important and can 
be implemented right away while the conflict is ongoing to support and assist survivors of 
CRSV. The New Lines Institute’s m ultilateral asset transfer proposal uses the law of state 
"countermeasures to show how Ukraine’s allies in the West, whose banks hold a combined $350 billion in frozen Russian assets, can transfer these assets to be held in escrow for the "
reconstruction of Ukraine beginning a s early as 2024. If the U.S. and European countries 
"move forward with these transfers, possibly funding the international registry and the proposed domestic registry, there needs to be coordination and collaboration among the "
"implemente rs and stakeholders, including survivors of CRSV. While Russia absolutely "
should pay for the destruction and devastation its war has caused to Ukraine and

"Ukrainians, the Ukrainian government should also work toward financially supporting "
"victims, especially with interim reparative measures and other forms of assistance. In "
"Bosnia, the government has failed to provide comprehensive justice and reparation to "
"survivors of CRSV,81 resulting in tens of thousands of survivors still struggling to access "
"necessary medical, financial, and psychosocial assistance. Reparations for CRSV survivors should be integrated into a broader reparations framework that includes other victims of "
"tortu re, victims of physical and psychological injury, and people who have lost family "
"members , who also have a right to reparation. The Ukrainian government should ensure "
"that CRSV victims are treated holistically, as many have been subject to other crimes "
"outside of CRSV for which they also need reparations . Finally, Ukraine must ensure that "
"its domestic laws enable the implementation of reparations for war victims, including CRSV survivors, which may require reform or the promulgation of new laws. If action i n "
"favor of victims of CRSV can move the overall issue of reparations more quickly, then those working on reparations should use this  knowledge to leverage an opportunistic "
approach to advancing legislative action. 
"3. Free Legal Aid : In Bosnia, there exists double jeopardy for wartime torture victims , who "
"are forced to pay court costs to Republika Srpska after their compensation claims are rejected on the grounds of the statute of limitations. Ukraine must maintain, and should "
"even expand, its policy of free legal aid, especially to victims of CRSV. All war survivors "
should be provided no- cost legal counsel to ensure their effective participation in both 
"criminal and reparations proceedings. Most CRSV survivors are impoverished and cannot afford necessary medications or food for themselves and family members, so they certainly "
"won’t be able to afford court fees. As the Global Survivor Fund Study on Ukraine details, "
going through the reparations process should be reparative in and of itself.
82 Providing 
survivors with the necessary support to take their cases to court and to receive compensation will help to ensure that participating in these processes is reparative for them. 
"Survivors of CRSV should not have to bear any further cost s, however they choose to "
pursue justice and accountability for the harm inflicted upon them by Russian forces.  
"4. Criminal Proceedings : In Bosnia, it took 15 years to find Ratko Mladić and Radovan "
"Karadžić, men who were instrumental in the Bosnian genocide and who were eventually convicted by the ICTY of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. While there "
"is no statute of limitations on prosecuting war crimes in Ukraine, including crimes of sexual "
"violence, there is a limitation for the pretrial investigation. If the suspect is not found within 18 months, the case must be closed. The Ukrainian Parliament should pass the proposed "
"bill by the Committee on Law Enforcement Activities that addresses this oversight, "
regarding the Criminal Procedure Code of Ukraine on Improving the Procedure for Conducting Pretrial Investigations and Trials in Criminal Proceedings Regarding Crimes 
Related to Sexual Violence Committed in Conditions of Armed Conflict.

"has been indicted in Ukraine for crimes relating to CRSV, there should be no statute of "
"limitations for the pretrial investigation period. Additionally, Parliament should expand the "
"statute of limitations to include all CRSV, not just rape. Criminal law pr ohibitions should "
be more fully stipulated in the national law in accordance with international human rights standards.   
5. Align National and International Legislation : T
 he NGO Trial International in Bosnia 
focuses on recommending structural amendments to Bosnian law in order to align national 
"legislation with international human rights instruments and practices, such as access to "
reparations for victims of sexual violence. Ukrainian law should likewise be aligned with 
"international human rights instruments and practices, and the government should engage "
"in consultations with key stakeholders , including civil society organizations and victims "
"and survivors themselves , to design new and robust legislation that is survivor -centered "
"and trauma -informed. In particular, investigations and documentation of CRSV crimes "
should align with the standards laid out in the International Protocol on the Documentation 
and Investigation of Sexual Violence in Conflict.84 The Mukwege Foundation’s 
“Guidebook on State Obligations for Conflict- Related Sexual Violence” will be helpful in 
identifying international legislation.  
"6. Victims in Occupied Territories:  I n Bosnia, there are many barriers to victims of CRSV "
"getting access  to justice and reparations, especially in Republika  Srpska. Though Bosnia is "
"not a formal partition and was created by international agreement, the resulting state government mechanisms are less powerful than if Bosnia had one united governing system "
"because government devolves to the entity level – thus, the federal state has limited agency "
"and power. Further, not all survivors of CRSV have been able to access reparations because of where they live, continued interethnic discrimination, and other arbitrary measures. "
"Survivors’ access to services, including reparations, depends entirely on t heir place of "
residence due to the complexities of multiple governments. The GSF study on Bosnia 
"reports that only about 1,000 survivors (out of the estimated 20,000 to 50,000 women "
"raped) have obtained, or are in the process of obtaining, some form of reparation for "
CRSV.85 This is critical to note because if Russia succeeds in its illegal occupation and 
"annexation of parts Ukraine, the rights of Ukrainian victims could be jeopardized in the same manner. Should this occur in Ukraine, any Ukrainian victims in the Russian- occupied "
"territories would be very unlikely to have access to any form of justice or reparations, as Russia will deny that Ukrainians are a distinct ethnic group and would be more likely to "
deny these crimes took place. Accountability and reparations would simply become out of 
reach for the vast majority of victims who would be living in an annexed Ukraine under 
"Russian control. As Ukraine faces an ever -growing caseload of war crimes, ensuring that "
barriers to prosecut ion are not too high (which is not to say reducing the standard of proof 
for conviction) and following the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to

Reparation outlined by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights will be important. Ukraine can learn many lessons from the deficiencies of Bosnia’s 
"reparations program, including to remove any statute of limitations to apply for reparations; "
"to protect survivors’ identities throughout criminal trials, including if the survivor seeks "
"civil damages; and to ensure equitable access to reparations, regardless of where the "
survivors end up residing. 
7. Documentation in Occupied Territories:  Regarding the right to reparation for 
"individuals living in Russian- occupied territories, there will be evidentiary challenges "
"specific to CRSV survivors. Individuals in these areas, which have been illegally occupied "
"by Russia since 2014, may have Russian documents due to the nature of occupation. Should "
"Ukraine successfully push Russia out of these Ukrainian territories, the Ukrainian government must accept these documents when they are submitted by survivors as part  of "
proof of gross violations of international human rights law and serious violations of international humanitarian law.  
8. Children Born of Wartime Rape:  I
" t is estimated that approximately 2,000 to 4,000 "
Bosnian children were born after Serb- aligned forces raped their mothers during the 
"Bosnian war,86 but they are often forgotten as victims and left out of the reparative justice "
and transitional justice processes. Children who are conceived from sexual violence in 
"conflict also face extensive sociocultural barriers to social inclusion, potential "
"discri mination, and legal hurdles for full representation. Many of these “invisible children,” "
"now young adults, have faced obdurate barriers and difficulties throughout their lives due to the marginalization and stigmatization they have faced as children born o f wartime rape. "
"In July 2022, the Br čko District of Bosnia -Herzegovina passed legislation concerning "
"civilian victims of war, which included unprecedented legal recognition of children born "
"of wartime sexual violence (“children born of war”) as victims of  the war. Notably, Bosnia "
is the first country in Europe to pass such a law.
"87 Additionally, the Federation Parliament "
"adopted the Law for Protection of the Civil Victims of War on July 27, 2023, which "
"extended services and benefits to all Bosnian victims of war, the definition of which now "
encompasses more than 50% of Bosnians when including the Br čko District’s law.88 
Ukraine should learn from this step forward and put in place legal protections for children born of wartime rape in Ukraine. This will allow those children to begin the fight for 
"recognition and for reparations immediately, instead of having to wait almost 30 years for "
"this necessary recognition, as so many Bosnians have had to do. "
9. Prosecute Ukrainians:  Bosnian prosecutors in the Bosnian OPG have spoken about how 
hard it is to prosecute Bosniaks who committed war crimes. Ukraine should not repeat this 
mistake. Ukraine must make sure to register cases and to investigate and prosecute 
members of its own Ukrainian armed forces or others who committed CRSV and other

crimes against their own people or those aligned with Russia during the conflict. Justice 
should be for all survivors; it cannot be politically selective. 
10. Witness Support:  The Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina created a witness support 
"mechanism to, in theory, provide victims and witnesses with psychosocial support before, "
"during, and after testimony. Psychosocial support must be made available holistically and "
"sustainably to survivors of CRSV. In Ukraine, if prosecutors want victims of CRSV to "
"come forward to testify, the system must continue to offer support following their testimony. In Bosnia, professional psychological assistance is provided through the "
"Witness Support Office, which uses a survivor -centered approach and facilitates the "
"testifying process. The Ukrainian OPG currently works with its partners to provide medical and psychological support, evacuation assistance, and material assistance to survivors of "
CRSV on an ongoing basis. It will be important to maintain and expand this assistance in 
"the coming years and to ensure that all victims of CRSV, including men, those with diverse "
"SOGIESC, and other groups are supported. "
11. Technology:  Virtual reality technology can be used to support CRSV survivors through 
"court proceedings, including the use of face filters or avatars while testifying, and other "
innovations.
89 This relatively new technology is a vital additional mechanism to support 
survivors while they are participating in the judicial process. This could be boosted by 
"centers that provide psychosocial services for survivors, as mentioned above. "
For the United States  
1. Presidential Memorandum on Accountability for CRSV (PM) : The U.S. government 
should use the PM to the fullest extent to designate sanctions for perpetrators of CRSV in Ukraine. This will set an important precedent for future U.S. sanctions designations in other 
"conflicts. So far, the PM has been used by the Office of Foreign Assets Control to sanction "
two South Sudanese officials and by the U.S. Department of State to sanction two Islamic 
State leaders responsible for CRSV.
90 These designations mark the first time that the 
commission or tolerance of CRSV has led to an imposition of sanctions by the U.S. The 
"challenge with these types of sanctions is that the process for gathering evidence, "
"packag ing it together, and then designat ing sanctions can be time- consuming. The "
Departments of Treasury and State should coordinate with Ukraine’s OPG Conflict -
"Related Sexual Violence Crimes Department, which has identified perpetrators in 62 cases of CRSV, as well as with local NGOs in Ukraine that have been collecting evidence. It will "
also be important to socialize the PM across government agencies working on issues related 
to Ukraine to make sure they are aware of CRSV and that the PM is a tool they can use for 
accountability. This can be done through briefings and trainings across the interagency. 
While the State Department is already coordinating with a coalition of human rights -
"focused NGOs, it should expand coordination to gender -focused coalitions such as the U.S. "
Civil Society Working Group on WPS and the International Civil Society Action Network 
for assistance connecting with local civil society organizations that can help provide some

of the necessary information needed for sanctions packages or visa restrictions. The 
upcoming update to the U.S. Strategy and National Action Plan on WPS should include 
"information on CRSV and the PM so that understanding what CRSV is, that CRSV "
"constitute s a human rights violation, and that there exists a tool to address it becomes "
institutionalized across federal agencies  and U.S. embassies. While the PM signals that 
"preventing and punishing CRSV is a priority of this administration, it is unclear whether "
this will continue through future administrations ; civil servants across federal agencies  
"must ensure this prioritization continues, especially given the U.S.’ s obligations under "
"international law, such as the Genocide Convention (discussed above). A key implementing agency missing from the PM is the Department of Defense (DOD). The "
DOD should be part of any conversations around security assistance and should take on an 
“early warning” role based on its intelligence gathering capabilities. The U.S. Intelli gence 
"Community comprises 18 organizations, nine of which are in the DOD."
"91 Therefore, DOD "
should share all intelligence on CRSV taking place in a conflict zone with all appropriate 
U.S. government agencies. This should be stipulated in the PM and listed separately under 
"the mandate of the DOD’s a ssistant secretary of defense for strategy, plans , and "
capabilities. The DOD should also be required to have assigned staff to interagency task 
"forces related to CRSV. Further, in all official U.S. Women, Peace, and Security documents "
"and references, especially under the auspices of the PM, CRSV directed at women, children, and people with diverse SOGIESC  during armed conflict s should be explicitly "
referenced as a particular vulnerability.  
2. Crimes Against Humanity : The United States does not have a statute criminalizing 
"CAHs, which creates a huge gap in accountability measures available to U.S. prosecutors. The U.S. is effectively a “safe haven” for perpetrators of CAHs due to this loophole in "
American law.
92 Congress should work to strengthen U.S. laws on atrocity crimes by 
enacting legislation to prevent and punish crimes against humanity. This will help the U.S. to support legal accountability efforts for the Russia -Ukraine war as well as other conflicts. 
Congress should refer to documents prepared by the American Bar Association’s Working 
Group of Crimes Against Humanity.

"Sexual violence asweapon of warMarta Havryshko14 March 2023Sexual violence is being usedsystematically by the Russianmilitary in Ukraine to achievethe political goals of the Russianleadership, and is not just theresult of ‘indiscipline’ or abuse ofpower.War-time sexual violence has existed for aslong as wars themselves. Memory aboutmass sexual crimes during World War II stilllives – for example, those committed byWehrmacht and its allies on the occupiedterritories, by the Imperial Japanese Army(the phenomena of the so-called ‘comfortwomen’), by the Red Army in Hungary andGermany, etc. Despite the vast scale of thosecrimes, the post-war tribunals didn’t pay dueattention to punishing the guilty, mostly forpolitical reasons and the overallunderestimation of the role sexual violence20/06/2024, 00:51Page 1 of 34"
"plays in war.A pivotal shift in international lawsregarding this issue happened only in the1990s. It was the result of trials concerningthe genocides in Rwanda and ex-Yugoslavia,where "
"hundreds of thousands of peoplesuffered sexual violence, mostly women andgirls. Since then, wartime sexual violence hasstarted to be treated as ‘war crimes’, ‘crimesagainst humanity’ and ‘crimes of genocide’.Wartime sexual crimes began to becharacterized as a ‘method’, ‘tool’, ‘weapon’,or ‘tactic’ of war or genocide.Since the full-scale Russian invasion ofUkraine on 24 February 2022, the topic ofsexual violence has flooded the media,political, military, human rights advocacy,and research discourses. Their focuses areforms and consequences of sexual violencecommitted by Russian servicemen inUkraine. This article focuses on the natureand function of sexual violence, and thequestion of whether Russia uses sexualviolence as a weapon in its war againstUkraine.Warning: this text contains depictions ofsexual violence.20/06/2024, 00:51Page 2 of 34"

"Because Russian aggression against Ukraineis ongoing, the picture of the crimescommitted by Russian soldiers is incomplete.20/06/2024, 00:51Page 4 of 34"
Sexual violence is a part of the large-scaleand systematic crimes being perpetratedagainst the Ukrainian population (accordingto the Ukrainian 
"Prosecutor General’s Office,more than 71 thousand offences have beencommitted so far). But unlike the destructionof architectural objects, murders, andinjuries which can be seen visually anddocumented, sexual violence is among themost hidden consequences of the war.Despite that, information about sexualviolence committed by Russian servicemen isnow documented by Ukrainian andinternational human rights organizations,particularly the UN, Human Rights Watch,Amnesty International, the Center for CivilLiberties, JurFem, LaStrada, Women’sPerspectives and others who provide supportto the victims. Many publications in foreignmedia contain interviews with victimsthemselves. Another important source ofinformation are the intercepted calls ofRussian servicemen, which are regularlypublished by the Ukrainian Security Service.In them, occupiers discuss various crimescommitted on Ukrainian territory, includingsexual ones.Data on sexual violence and its perpetratorsis also spread by the Ministry of InternalAffairs and Prosecutor General’s Office. Inparticular, they report to Ukrainian society20/06/2024, 00:51Page 5 of 34"
"about the number of cases investigated,charges put forward, and "
first sentences.They also inform about 
"coordinationbetween different state institutions andcooperation with western partners to opposewar-caused sexual violence and help thevictims. However, not all officials showed aproper level of responsibility whilecommunicating this sensitive subject.In April 2022, the former ombudswoman"
"Ludmyla Denisova came under criticismfrom media workers and NGOs. She wasadvised to ‘choose every word more carefullyand thoroughly’, especially when talkingabout sexual violence against children, andreport about the procedural actionsconcerning every case publicized. Soon,"
Denisova was fired from theombudswoman’s position. That 
bolstered
further speculations about the topic of sexualviolence during the war. Both the number ofcases voiced by Denisova – 
she claimed
hundreds of incidents back at the beginning
"of April – and their truthfulness were put indoubt. She found out about most of themfrom calls on the hotline for psychologicalhelp for those who suffered because of thewar, "
created with the support of UNICEF.Denisova explained that 
she couldn’t pass all
"information known to her to lawenforcement because she didn’t have consent20/06/2024, 00:51Page 6 of 34"
"from the victims.The ‘Denisova case’ demonstrated thechallenges Ukrainian society faces withdocumenting, investigating, andcommunicating war crimes. The rights andinterests of victims and their close onesshould be at the centre of these processes.There are human tragedies behind everypublished case, which is why each onedeserves proper attention and checking.Silence and devaluation are preciselyRussia’s strategy in its information waragainst Ukraine. Kremlin politicians andpropagandists "
used the ‘Denisova case’ toundermine all information published by theUkrainian side concerning sexual crimescommitted by Russian servicemen inUkraine.

"The specificity of sexual crimesin Russia’s war against UkraineAfter the occupation of Crimea by Russia andthe beginning of the war in Donbas, theUkrainian prosecutor’s office and police"
"started documenting sexual crimes related tothe conflict. Between 2014 and 2017, theEastern Ukrainian centre for civic initiativescollected information about 175 cases ofsexual violence against men and women byillegal military formations. It included rapeand threats of rape, sexual torture, forcednudity, threats of sexual nature, forcedprostitution, threats and attempts atcastration, etc. But after the full-scaleRussian invasion of Ukraine, sexual violencecommitted by Russian servicemen acquired adifferent scale, intensity and character.First, sexual violence became widespread. Itis difficult to talk about the exact number ofvictims. The Ukrainian Prosecutor General’sOffice is currently investigating "
around 155
"cases of sexual violence. And that number ismerely the tip of the iceberg in the context ofthe overall scale of sexual violence, because itincludes only cases with clear consent onprocedural actions by the victims.Most victims aren’t willing to testify forvarious reasons. Some are afraid of"
"120/06/2024, 00:51Page 8 of 34"
"stigmatization, victim-blaming and mistrust.Some people want to push painful memoriesout to avoid traumatizing themselves andtheir close ones. Some don’t believe injustice. Others are afraid to testify while thewar is ongoing because they live in fear ofoccupiers returning and possible revenge forshedding light on their crimes. Some lack theresources to start a long and exhausting fightfor justice. Thus, the number of those whosuffered from sexual violence may be nothundreds but thousands, considering howmany Ukrainians are now in Russiancaptivity or on temporarily occupiedterritories of Ukraine.Second, sexual violence has become a tool ofterror not against certain groups but againstthe whole population of the occupiedUkrainian territories. The victims are nownot only women and men, but also childrenand the elderly. After breaking into the homeof 75-years old Ludmyla near Kherson, theRussian soldier "
brutally beat and raped her.Another 83-year-old woman was 
raped by a
"Russian soldier in front of her husband,bedridden due to an illness."
"According to the UN data, the youngestcurrently known victim is only four years old."
"Instances of gang-raping girls aged 9 to 11are known in Bucha, Kyiv region. It’s alsoknown from the talks among the Russian20/06/2024, 00:51Page 9 of 34"
"military, intercepted by the UkrainianSecurity Service, that "
10 of their soldiers
"raped a 12-year-old girl in the Luhanskregion, and three others – a "
"16-year-old girl.Among the victims, there are also boys,particularly an 11-year-old, "
raped in front of
"his mother.Third, sexual crimes are committed withoutstanding and demonstrative cruelty. Thisis evidenced not only by the age of thevictims and the presence of the members ofvulnerable groups among them – children orthe elderly – but also by the dynamics andmanifestations of that violence. In manycases, it is not a brief act but may go on forhours, days or weeks, taking the form ofsexual torture to satisfy the aggressor. It isespecially typical for sexual violence in placesof forced detention.The UN Human Rights Monitoring Missionin Ukraine documented in its report thetestimony of a man who was kept nearOlenivka in the Donetsk region. He stressedthat occupiers "

Sexual violence is oneway to demonstrate authority, to terrorize,humiliate, intimidate, and demoralize the‘enemy’, and to reduce their will to resist.That’s why it takes grotesque anddemonstrative forms.Perpetrators act in ways that make thevictims realize the meaning of the violencefor their torturers.

"maximize the harm. This is whatdistinguishes wartime sexual violence fromthat committed in times of peace, where it’susually done secretly to conceal the crimeand thus to avoid responsibility. Criminalsoften don’t think about responsibility in theoccupied territories. They are interestedforemost in asserting their power andachieving both personal and military-political goals. This is why violence takespublic forms and happens in the presence ofrelatives, friends, neighbours or other peoplewho are with the victim in a shelter or placesof detention.The presence of witnesses, especially closefriends and relatives, causes the victimadditional suffering and time traumatizeseyewitnesses, because usually they aren’table to help. They are made to observe thetorture silently and helplessly. As a result,witnesses become victims themselves andmay live through trauma, similar in intensityand symptoms to the trauma of the so-called‘primary’ victims.

"goalsSexual violence becomes a tool of war whenit serves the tactical and/or strategicinterests of a fighting army, rather than justthe individual interests of particular soldiers;in other words, when it is not just the resultof a lack of discipline, but a factor intendedby the aggressor to bring the achievement ofmilitary-political goals closer.Commanders are aware that theirsubordinates commit sexual violence onoccupied territories against the civilianpopulation or prisoners of war, but don’toppose it effectively. They don’t implementpreventive enlightenment or disciplinaryaction, and they don’t punish theperpetrators properly. Wayne Jordash, aBritish lawyer who consults Ukrainianprosecutors, stated that he "

"Some commanders try to use sexual violenceas kind of a reward for their soldiers, a wayto encourage them and boost their morale,especially with poorly motivated soldiers likethe mobilized ones. At the same time, sexualviolence may be perceived by commanders asan acceptable and ‘safe’ way to channelsoldiers’ rage and frustration caused bydefeats on the battlefield and unhappinesswith the conditions of service.Hence, it’s not a coincidence that Russiansoldiers committed many crimes againstcivilians when retreating from territoriessuch as "

"form cohesion andcollective values in the army – a sharedexperience of crimes as something thatbrings soldiers closer. Considering that manypeople who ended up in the Russian army,especially since the start of mobilization inSeptember 2022, didn’t previously knowmuch about the war and probably didn’t planto participate in it, sexual violence (as well asother crimes) might be a form of ritual formilitary socialization.Gang rape as a way to form fraternity amongRussian soldiers can be seen in the "

 The impact of stigma…
"Written by Florina Neagu, edited by Manuel Torres LajoSince Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, more than 8 million peoplehave left the country and sought refuge in neighbouring states such as Poland, Romania,Hungary and Slovakia (UNHCR, 2022). Most of the refugees spread across Europe arewomen and children, many of which are victims of human rights violations committedduring the war, especially in the occupied areas. Recent reports, however, have revealedThe violation of sexual andThe violation of sexual andreproductive health and rights ofreproductive health and rights ofrefugee women from Ukraine, victimsrefugee women from Ukraine, victimsof CRSV, in Poland, Hungary, Slovakiaof CRSV, in Poland, Hungary, Slovakiaand Romaniaand RomaniaHome2023August9The violation of sexual and reproductive health and rights of refugee womenfrom Ukraine, victims of CRSV, in Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania"
"20/06/2024, 00:56Page 1 of 20"
"that such violations are also experienced once refugees have crossed the borders ofUkraine and reached the European Union. In particular, there are concerns regarding thevictims of conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) and how the laws in host countriesactually exacerbate the gendered impact of this war and impose barriers on access tosexual and reproductive health services (Center for Reproductive Rights et al., 2023). Conflict-related Sexual Violence in the Russo-Ukrainian WarOfficial reports revealed that violations of human rights and international humanitarianlaw have been committed in Ukraine since the first months of the conflict (Gall &Boushnak, 2023; McKernan, 2022). More specifically, there is evidence that women of allages have faced sexual violence, including rape and forced nudity, often in front of theirchildren and other family members, in areas occupied by the Russian armed forces(OHCHR, 2022b). The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine (2023)further mentioned that such acts were committed during house searches, atcheckpoints, in confinement or in spaces where women sought refuge from the conflict—such as basements and bomb shelters—, in areas such as Kyiv, Kharkiv, Kherson orChernihiv. These allegations are just some of the risks that girls and women are facing inthe country, whether internally displaced or forced to cross the border. OHCHR (2022b)also raised concerns about sexual exploitation, human trafficking, domestic violence andother forms of gender-based discrimination which mainly affect women. Officials of the United Nations (Gans, 2022) and OSCE (2022) have officially claimed thatthe Russian Federation uses rape as a weapon of war. After all, the use of sexual violencein conflict as a tool of military strategy can be encountered in several conflicts aroundthe world and it is currently deemed a war crime within the international humanitarianlaw framework. In Ukraine, whether as a form of punishment, humiliation ordehumanisation, this horrifying act affects mainly women and girls (Wamsley, 2022) andits consequences reveal the gendered impact of this armed conflict. It is also importantto note that, while women are primarily the victims of these acts, boys, men andmembers of the LGBTQ+ community have also faced sexual violence (Berger, 2022;Kulick, 2022). Nevertheless, since women are usually more likely to remain in occupiedzones due to their caregiving responsibilities towards children and elder family members(Horne, 2023), they are at higher risk of becoming victims of conflict-related sexualviolence. At the same time, due to martial law being in place, they also represent themajority of people fleeing the country.20/06/2024, 00:56Page 2 of 20"
"From the beginning of the Russian invasion until 31 October 2022, approximately 86 casesof conflict-related sexual violence were officially documented in different regions ofUkraine (HRMMU, 2022). The atrocities committed in Bucha, for example, which becameknown worldwide, included the rape of 25 girls, 9 of which became pregnant after theseunspeakable acts (Limaye, 2022). However, it is difficult to know its real scale and thenumber of victims is predicted to be much higher than what is currently reported.Consequently, it is also almost impossible to know how many women, victims of sexualviolence, crossed the border in the countries under discussion. As Ukraine’s prosecutorgeneral mentioned last year (King, 2022), sexual violence is usually underreported due tostigma and the consequences towards victims. Many survivors are reluctant to sharetheir experiences and suffer long-term trauma (Mannell, 2022), especially in the absenceof effective services to support them. Moreover, in an active conflict and in occupiedareas, it is even more difficult to ensure a thorough investigation and begin criminalproceedings against the perpetrators. In this context, women from Ukraine who are victims of CRSV should be able to haveaccess to sexual and reproductive health services. These include emergencycontraception, safe abortions or medical support for sexually transmitted diseases,among others. Within the Ukrainian borders, this may be limited due to the destruction ofmany health facilities and the shortage of medicines. Therefore, many seek help andhope to undertake time-sensitive procedures such as abortions in neighbouringcountries. Moreover, they might be in need of psychological support and long-term caredue to the trauma caused by war crimes. Poland, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia are all members of the European Union and as aconsequence, they should follow the rules set by the Temporary Protection Directiveadopted in March 2022. According to this protection mechanism, countries shouldensure medical access to people coming from Ukraine. However, a recent report (Centerfor Reproductive Rights et al., 2023) has shown that the restrictive policies in place onemergency contraception and abortion make it almost impossible for refugees fromUkraine to access services regarding their sexual reproductive health and rights (SRHR).Moreover, the impact of gender-based violence in these countries creates anenvironment where such acts are tolerated and victims are often silenced and leftunprotected.Access to SRHR in neighbouring countries20/06/2024, 00:56Page 3 of 20"
"While Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania are among the neighbouring countrieswhere women from Ukraine first seek refuge, they are also some of the states with themost restrictive SRHR policies in Europe (Diamondstein, 2022). Particularly the three firstcountries have implemented laws which impose barriers to those seeking emergencycontraception or abortion. What all the mentioned countries have in common is also thelack of effective policies against gender-based violence or victim support mechanisms.As a consequence, gender inequality, domestic violence, sexual harassment or rape arehighly tolerated in society, which makes it even more difficult for victims of such acts toseek help. Poland is already known in Europe and worldwide as one of the countries with the mostrestrictive abortion and emergency contraception policies. More specifically, abortion onrequest is not legalised and is permitted only when the pregnancy poses a risk to apregnant woman’s health and life, or when it is a result of rape or incest, until the 12thweek of the pregnancy. In October 2020, the Constitutional Tribunal ruled that abortionon the grounds of “severe and irreversible foetal defect or incurable illness that threatensthe fetus’ life” is unconstitutional, marking it one of the strictest policies in this domain(Amnesty International, 2022b). Moreover, anyone who assists women in performing anabortion or who provides them with emergency contraception can be prosecuted. Earlierthis year, Justyna Wydrzyńska became the first person to be sentenced in Europe forhelping another woman to terminate her pregnancy (Easton, 2023), under Polish law. Nevertheless, given these provisions, ending a pregnancy resulting from rape seems tobe legal. However, what many organisations in the country report are the difficultiesencountered in practice when someone requests such a procedure. More specifically,few abortions resulting from rape are actually carried out as the procedure is not alwaysaccessible to Polish women and others in their situation. To be eligible, authorities needto undertake criminal investigations and women have to provide official documentationas proof. Moreover, due to increased restrictions and the fear of being criminallyprosecuted, many doctors refuse to perform this procedure (Biedron, 2022). Otherschoose to invoke the so-called “conscience clause” or state that performing an abortionis against their religious beliefs. These aspects were encountered in a recent case wheretwo hospitals refused this procedure to an underage rape victim, although she haddocuments from the public prosecutor and all the grounds necessary for a legalabortion (Lepiarz, 2023).  "

"In Hungary, although abortion has been legal since 1953 (Cursino, 2022), the intention ofthe current government to raise the birth rate and its tendency to publicly supporttraditional family values have also impacted SRHR policies. In this regard, the Orbangovernment’s Constitution from 2011 stated that it guarantees that “the life of a fetus willbe protected from conception” (Strzyżyńska, 2022). Hungarian society is known for beingpro-choice and as a consequence, abortion until the 12th week of pregnancy is allowedby law, on grounds similar to Poland such as the risk to women’s health, if it is a result ofrape or, additionally, if the fetus has a serious health impairment. Moreover, it is alsoallowed in the case of “a serious crisis situation that causes physical or mental disruptionor social impossibility” (Kafkadesk Budapest Office, 2021). In practice, while these grounds do not necessarily need to be proved, a woman seekingan abortion needs to do two compulsory appointments with a childcare/family worker,after the pregnancy is confirmed by a gynaecologist. During these visits, women usuallyreceive counselling and information on adoption services or benefits provided by thestate (Strzyżyńska, 2022). Such conditions are often used to convince them to changetheir minds or even to stigmatise women for the choices made. Furthermore, there is aban on medical abortion (known also as abortion pills) and recently, the governmentintroduced the mandatory condition for every pregnant woman to listen to the fetus’sheartbeat before undertaking the surgical procedure (Cursino, 2022). Similar to Poland,doctors can also refuse to conduct an abortion based on conscientious grounds andemergency contraception can only be accessed with a prescription after a medical visit. Refugee women from Ukraine also encounter difficulties in Slovakia, another country thathas come to the aid of people fleeing from war. According to a law which has been inplace since 1993, women can request to terminate a pregnancy within the 12 weekstimeframe without any justification. Similar to Hungary, they have to go throughmandatory counselling appointments on possible alternatives to this procedure and theconsequences of abortion and then wait approximately 48 hours before terminating thepregnancy (Center for Reproductive Rights et al., 2023). Similar to the countries analysedpreviously, surgical abortion is the only legalised form, and the costs are relatively high,especially for those women with low incomes. Moreover, doctors and hospitals canrefuse to perform abortions on conscientious grounds, a practice that has been widelyused in the country. Slovakia has also been known in the past decade for its attempts to impose more"

"restrictions on SRHR policies. For example, in  2018, 19 proposals were discussed in thisregard, and the most recent ones, in April 2022, raised serious concerns regarding theaccess of refugee women to terminate their pregnancies. More specifically, theproposals discussed in the Parliament considered banning abortion on request, excepton grounds similar to Poland, and restricting these procedures for foreigners without aresidence permit, to challenge the so-called “abortion tourism” (Nešťáková, 2022). Whilenone of these proposals passed, they are just the latest attempts to restrict the access ofwomen, including refugees, to emergency contraception and safe abortion (AmnestyInternational, 2022a). Romania has been known, especially during the Communist regime, for its restrictivepolicies in terms of abortion. After the fall of Communism, the tendency was to legalisesuch procedures and implement more SRHR policies for women. In the last threedecades, abortion on request has been legal for up to 14 weeks, with no justificationneeded. Further, the laws in place have ensured free and direct access to ambulatoryand specialised care for refugees, including for those coming from Ukraine (Center forReproductive Rights et al., 2023). Nevertheless, in the last decade, the government cut thefunding to contraceptive measures and the Parliament recently modified a law whichpreviously introduced sex education in schools. In this context, Romania is the countrywith one of the highest percentages of underage pregnancies in Europe, especially dueto the lack of education and inaccessible sexual and reproductive health services. The biggest concern in Romania at the moment is that many public hospitals refuse toterminate pregnancies, based on a conscientious objection clause in the ProfessionalCode for Medics. During the Covid-19 pandemic, access to such procedures wasespecially heavily impacted since abortions were not considered emergency healthcareservices. Following an investigation, FILIA Centre, a women’s rights organisation inRomania, revealed that during the pandemic, approximately 200 abortion procedureswere performed at home, without any specialised help. Moreover, in the first six monthsof 2022, the number of abortions performed in the private healthcare system doubledand approximately 69 public hospitals declared that they do not conduct this procedure,due to religious beliefs and other moral and ethical grounds. Out of the Romanianhospitals contacted by FILIA Centre (2023), only 9 of them provided access to medicalabortion.In recent years, civil society has also been concerned about the rise of anti-choice actors20/06/2024, 00:56Page 6 of 20"
"in Romania (Schwartzburg, 2022). These organisations are often funded by donors fromother European countries or the United States of America and have succeeded inopening support centres for pregnant women, where they often share false informationabout abortion and its consequences. One example is Heartbeat International, one of thelargest anti-choice organisations in the world. In the context of the war in Ukraine, thisorganisation opened crisis pregnancy centres and provides counselling in both Ukrainianand Russian language to refugee women who come to Romania regarding theconsequences of terminating a pregnancy (Cilibiu, 2022). Many of these actors have alsoreached the level of political representation and managed to influence laws on children’srights or education which indirectly have an impact on SRHR policies.The impact of such restrictions on refugees from Ukraine, victims of CRSVFor victims of CRSV, the laws imposed in host countries regarding SRHR can aggravatethe impact of such crimes. Many would seek access to emergency contraception andabortion because continuing a pregnancy resulting from rape can prolong the already-lived trauma and stigma within their own community. This is often linked with a highoccurrence of gender-based violence and exclusion, which can indefinitely affectwomen. Moreover, other issues might occur, such as sexually transmitted diseases,genital trauma, miscarriage or mortality, determining the need for immediate access tosexual and reproductive health services. CRSV causes not only long-term physical harmbut also psychological wounds, including post-traumatic stress, depression, anxiety andsuicide (Stark et al., 2022). Therefore, it is important to analyse how the barriers imposedto SRHR in each of the countries under this discussion impact refugee women. In the case of Polish law, refugees from Ukraine who are victims of rape during theconflict have to go through a criminal investigation and provide official documents torequest an abortion within a 12-week timeframe. In most cases, as previously mentioned,such investigations are almost impossible to conduct, especially in areas with activeconflict. As a consequence, many Ukrainian women resort to abortions in unsafeconditions or to medicine which is often procured illegally. Since the state imposedadditional restrictive policies, FEDERA, an organisation that works in Poland, estimatesthat approximately 150,000 procedures are performed illegally (Lepiarz, 2023), whichcould heavily impact the safety of women. Others seek support in neighbouring countries. However, pursuing an abortion abroad20/06/2024, 00:56Page 7 of 20"
"could prove very costly for refugee women coming from Ukraine, due to their vulnerableposition and limited financial resources (Amnesty International, 2022b; Schwartzburg,2022). The recent practice of prosecuting those who aid women seeking abortion andemergency contraception also causes fear among refugees who are reluctant to ask forsupport from their friends or host communities (Center for Reproductive Rights et al.,2023). While abortion resulting from rape is legal, Poland fails to offer support to womenvictims of CRSV in Ukraine by imposing barriers in practice which do not consider theirparticular position. Regarding the laws in place in Hungary and Slovakia, while abortion is officially legal, theconditions imposed for this procedure can become a bureaucratic and inaccessibleprocess for refugee women. For many victims of sexual violence in conflict, the additionalappointments, waiting times and documents necessary for requesting an abortion canbecome very challenging. In a context where many women from Hungary travel toneighbouring countries, such as Austria, refugee women from Ukraine find it difficult toaccess such sexual and reproductive health services under the public system and areforced to rely on personal financial resources. Similarly, in Slovakia, emergencycontraception is explicitly left out of the officially reimbursed medical services under thepublic health system and, just as an abortion, can prove very costly to women. Besidesthe cost barriers, there are also issues regarding the language, since women fromUkraine have to attend different appointments necessary for receiving a prescription orrequesting an abortion which are not that often conducted in Ukrainian (Center forReproductive Rights et al., 2023). While in Romania the laws are less restrictive and both surgical and medical abortioncan be requested in some hospitals, the refusal of doctors to perform such procedurescan prove devastating for refugee women, similar to the other countries. In practice, notmany public hospitals offer access to free sexual and reproductive healthcare. As aconsequence, women from poor backgrounds and refugees, victims of CRSV, cannotafford to terminate their pregnancies in private hospitals or access contraceptionwithout the support of civil society organisations. Particularly in the case of womencoming from Ukraine, despite the laws in place, many of them have to register with afamily doctor and undertake a bureaucratic process and numerous appointments toaccess the services needed (Center for Reproductive Rights et al., 2023, OHCHR, 2022b).In addition to these legal, cost and language barriers, a recent study carried in the20/06/2024, 00:56Page 8 of 20"
"countries under discussion revealed that there is a stigma surrounding SRHR andgender-based violence (Center for Reproductive Rights et al., 2023). As a consequence,many refugee women face harmful stereotypes and humiliation when requesting anabortion or contraceptive measures in countries where such services are legallyprovided (Center for Reproductive Rights et al., 2023). Moreover, what is available forvictims of gender-based violence is not as effective as in the rest of Europe, and Poland,Hungary, Slovakia and Romania still lack the services, protocols and training necessaryto support women. Discriminative gender norms and stereotypes which still persist inthese four countries have an impact on the experience of refugee women, who are oftenfaced with big discrepancies in terms of SRHR services compared to Ukraine. Furthermore, it is also relevant to mention that certain groups of refugee women, victimsof CRSV, are also at risk of intersectional discrimination. These countries are widely knownfor their discriminative attitude towards the LGBTQ+ and Roma communities, amongothers. Consequently, Ukrainian refugee women who belong to such groups often facediscrimination not only in terms of the restrictive SRHR policies but also because of theirethnic, sexual, racial or financial background. In this context, many refugees from Ukrainehave travelled back to their country temporarily to access SRHR services which are notprovided in Poland, Hungary, Slovakia or Romania (Center for Reproductive Rights et al.,2023). Such practice, however, raises important safety concerns, and financial andadministrative barriers, which aggravate the trauma suffered by victims of conflict-related sexual violence and their vulnerable position within society (Center forReproductive Rights et al., 2023). ConclusionsOverall, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania fail to provide the necessary sexual andreproductive health services for refugee women from Ukraine, who are victims of CRSV.While in theory terminating a pregnancy resulting from rape is legal and should beprovided by public hospitals, in practice there are numerous barriers that women face toaccess such procedures. Even in countries where medical abortion or emergencycontraception is legal, the bureaucratic process of receiving such support is making italmost impossible to benefit from it. Similar to women living in these countries, refugeescoming from Ukraine face numerous legal, administrative, cost and language obstacleswhen accessing services which could save their life. They are often faced with restrictivepolicies on performing abortions, the refusal of medical personnel, costly procedures and20/06/2024, 00:56Page 9 of 20"
"time-consuming mandatory appointments, which contribute to prolonging the traumasuffered by sexual violence in conflict. The states under discussion should reconsider the SRHR policies in place and analysehow such services restrict the access of refugee women to life-saving practices. Moreprocedures should be covered by the public health system and the governments ofthese countries must ensure that the legislation in place does not discriminate againstwomen coming from vulnerable backgrounds. Given the particular situation of refugeewomen victims of CRSV, they should dedicate more resources and effort to implementvictim-centred support services available to those suffering from both physical andpsychological harm caused by such acts. Moreover, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia andRomania have to take measures in eradicating in their countries gender-baseddiscrimination and violence, in order to create a safer environment for women. BibliographyAmnesty International.

"It’s been two years since the Russian aggression against Ukraine began. By October2022, seven months into the war, over eight million people had ﬂed.Upon arriving in an unknown country in the EU, many face barriers – especially womenand girls who have been exposed to conﬂict-related sexual violence.EIGE Director Carlien Scheele says:Two years on: women fleeing Russia’s war inUkraine need more supportNEWS ARTICLETOPICS:Health,Migration,Youth,ViolencePUBLICATION DATE:20 Feb 202420/06/2024, 00:41Page 1 of 5"
"At EU and Member State level, more specialised support and access is needed.Barriers to sexual and reproductive healthcare rightsThe Temporary Protection Directive (TPD) went into swift action in early March 2022.This was the ﬁrst time this instrument was used.It provided immediate support to millions ﬂeeing Ukraine in the EU in terms of housing,work permits, social welfare and healthcare.Today EIGE is publishing a study on Women ﬂeeing the war: Access to sexual andreproductive healthcare in the European Union under the Temporary Protection Directive.The study is based on a questionnaire across 26 Member States and follow-upinterviews held in four Member States: Czechia, Germany, Poland and Slovakia.It looked into six healthcare services including: emergency contraception, sexuallytransmitted infection (STI) prevention and treatment, obstetric and gynecological care,psychological counselling, and safe abortion and post-abortion care.Displacement already comes with physical and emotional tolls.  And on top ofthat, on their journey towards safety and stability, and what many of us don’trealise, people can become victims of gender-based violence. And this is mostlyhitting many women and girls.To make matters even more complex, they face barriers in accessing sexualand reproductive rights in host countries.“”20/06/2024, 00:41Page 2 of 5"
"These services are considered a bare medical minimum that victims must receive.Access, a""ordability and availability are key. The WHO sets clear timelines for eachservice, for example emergency contraception and STI prevention services need to beavailable as soon as possible, but not later than 72 hours after the assault.EIGE identiﬁed several gaps in the healthcare aspect of the TPD. Key ﬁndings include: "
"Victim-centred and trauma-informedCarlien adds:In 13 out of the 26 Member States surveyed only selected sexual andreproductive healthcare services are free of charge. Half of the Member States provide emergency contraception to minorswithout restrictions.Only half of the Member States have established rape crisis centres. Only seven Member States assign mandatory female professionals providingsexual and reproductive healthcare services – upon request only. Interviews conducted in selected countries highlight secondaryconsequences of restrictive legislation on sexual and reproductive rights. This leads to challenges in identifying health providers or delays in receivingnecessary care. In the most extreme cases, women and girls ﬂeeing the war need to travelabroad or back to conﬂict-zone to obtain this service.Women and girls face language barriers hampering their ability to meetneeds.   20/06/2024, 00:41Page 3 of 5"
"“The needs of victims must be at the heart of the response. Even though EIGE ﬁnds thatmost Member States have referral systems in place, the coordination between thepolice, healthcare, and social care sectors must be strengthened by introducingnational guidelines of responsibilities to ensure a holistic support system.”Leah Hoctor, Senior Director at the Center for Reproductive Rights, who havealso conducted research on barriers to sexual and reproductive healthcare servicesfor women ﬂeeing the war adds that: “Refugees from Ukraine still face signiﬁcant barriers to sexual and reproductivehealthcare in many parts of the EU, taking a signiﬁcant toll on their health andcompounding the trauma many endured before leaving Ukraine."" ""EU institutions and member states need to urgently address these barriers to ensurethat the EU’s promise of safety and security for refugees from Ukraine is realized for allwomen from Ukraine.”Strengthening future protectionMoving forward, the experience in applying the TPD should lead to permanentsolutions for victims.That means EU Institutions need to:There is no doubt that the limited access to sexual and reproductive healthcareworsens the traumatic experience for victims.“”"

SUMMARY  
 
Gender -based violence (GBV) is regarded among the most common human rights violations 
"and disproportionally affects women and girls. GBV, intimate partner violence (IPV), domestic "
violence (DV) and sexual violence (SV) are widespread in Ukraine. Registered incidences are 
on the rise and are compounded by the conflict in eastern Ukraine and the COVID -19 
pandemic.  
"• Socio -cultural barriers, behavioral patterns and attitudes towards GBV must be "
transformed through awareness -raising campaigns and gender mainstreaming.  
"• Effective prevention and combating GBV, IPV, DV and SV require human rights based, "
"sustained, multi -sectoral national programs and action plans.  "
• Advisory and coordination councils must be created and strengthened to f oster civic 
"engagement, develop and implement strategies and policies and to ensure transparent "
monitoring and evaluation.  
• Effective policymaking and response must be inclusive and involve all relevant rights -
holders and duty bearers.  
"• The collection and reporting of data must be improved, ensure confidentiality and the "
"right to privacy, and use harmonized methodologies and clearly defined and non -"
interchangeable terminology.  
• Co-ordination between all stakeholders must be improved and linked  with the 
commitment of state authorities to regularly monitor progress and review related legislation and 
policies.  
"• State authorities and stakeholders require capacity building in form of training, qualified "
"personnel, technical assistance and financial a nd organizational resources.  "
• The legal and institutional framework must be strengthened and aligned with 
"international Conventions, standards and good practices.  "
"• Confidential, non -judgmental, easily accessible referral mechanisms must be made "
available ac ross Ukraine including conflict affected areas.  
• All victims/survivors of GBV must be legally empowered and be made aware of their 
rights and available support systems.  
 
 
OVERVIE W 
"There is a general lack of data on GBV, IPV, DV and SV related issues and relevant data owners "
apply different collection and reporting methodologies. But available figures indicate that 
incidences in Ukraine are widespread and increasing. 115’000 reports of domestic violence (DV) 
"recorded by the National Police in 2018 increased by almost a quarter in 2019, and by 50% in "
"2020. Almost 80% of them were filed by women, the vast majority victims/survivors of repeated "
violence by former or intimate partners. Th e conflict in eastern Ukraine has increased numbers 
of registered violent situations. Women and girls are at higher risk of SV at entry -exit crossing 
points and due to higher military presence in residential areas. The conflict has broken family 
support sy stems and undermined men’s ability to fulfil their traditional gender roles resulting in 
negative coping mechanisms.  
"Women and girls are not only facing the risk of GBV but also associated negative health effects, "
psychological stress and trauma with ofte n encompassing long -term consequences. GBV keeps 
"and pushes victims/survivors out of employment and carries significant economic costs, "
estimated at more than USD 200 million per year in Ukraine and mostly borne by the 
"victims/survivors. GBV, IPV, DV and S V take root in historically unequal power relations between "
"women and men, are closely linked to gender -based discrimination, women’s economic "
 
 
         
  
2 
vulnerability and their subordinated position in the hierarchy of family relations. Despite a gradual 
"transformat ion of gender norms among younger men, Ukrainian men in general still demonstrate "
"a relatively high tolerance towards emotional, economic and physical violence. Unemployment, "
"limited access to livelihood, substance abuse and gambling, and now COVID -19 rela ted "
"lockdown measures, further drive incidence rates. Only an estimated 15% of all cases are "
"reported. A culture of silence, a sense of impunity, lack of confidentiality, acceptance of intimate "
"partner violence as a private matter, the belief in own coping abilities, the average higher social "
"status of men, fear of repeated abuse r aggression and of stigma and public condemnation "
discourage seeking for help. Referral pathways are often broken or non -existent. Trust in law 
"enforcement bodies and authorities is still insufficient. There is only limited access to safe places, "
medical and psychological support and justice for victims/survivors. Authorities lack capacities 
"to hold perpetrators accountable, but also to counsel and facilitate reintegration to prevent "
reoccurrence. Many women and girls are unaware of their rights and the av ailability of support 
"services. In conflict affected areas, law enforcement and support services have been severely "
degraded and military personnel and civilians who have been subjected to conflict lack 
rehabilitation. More than 30% of women whose partner has participated in the armed conflict in 
"eastern Ukraine has experienced physical or sexual abuse. Ukraine has recognized GBV, IPV, "
"DV and SV response and prevention as a national priority. In 2020, Ukraine became member of "
the Biarritz Partnership for Ge nder Equality and the President’s Decree “On Urgent Measures to 
"Prevent and Combat DV, GBV and Protect the Rights and Interests of Victims/Survivors of such "
Violence” came into force. Legislative advances have expanded the circle of people affected and 
"the list of entities involved in prevention and combatting DV, have made provisions for launching "
general and specialized support services for victims/survivors . DV was criminalized in 2019. 
"Ukraine is also signatory to the Istanbul Convention, which, however , remains unratified.  "
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS  
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and all subsequent International Covenants and 
Conventions enshrine the universal application to women and men of the rights and principles of 
"equality, security,  liberty, integrity and dignity of all human beings. Preventing gender -based "
"violence is transformational, it benefits individuals, the enjoyment of family life, communities and "
society at large and accelerates the achievement of Sustainable Development Go als. It first and 
foremost advances gender -equality and the empowerment of women and girls (SDG 5). It is critical 
in improving the health of women and children and wellbeing of families (SDG 3) and better 
"educational attainment (SDG 4). It reduces inequal ity (SDG 10), improves economic productivity "
and growth (SDG 8) and advances peace and justice (SDG 16).  
 
POLICY CONSIDERATIONS  
"• Effective response to GBV, IPV, DV and SV requires a human rights -based National Gender "
Equality Action Plan and a Program and Action Plan on prevention and response. They must 
"ensure a sustained approach of national, regional and local government, and bet ween the "
Legislature and Judiciary towards zero -tolerance policy at all levels.  
• Subnational advisory and coordination councils together with partnerships in GBV prevention 
and mitigation must be created and strengthened where in place. They must include h uman 
"rights organizations, local NGOs/CSOs, women’s and community activists, where feasible, "
and should ideally involve business membership organizations and trade unions.  
"• Policy must give special attention to vulnerable women, men, boys and girls includi ng "
"persons with disabilities, women and girls facing multiple forms of discrimination, elderly "
"persons, single -headed households in particular with children, minorities, persons living in "
 
 
         
  
3 
"poverty, persons in closed facilities, conflict -affected IDPs, asylu m seekers and refugees, "
and returnees and NGCA residents.  
"• The collection and reporting of data must be improved, ensure confidentiality and the right "
"to privacy, and include information concerning gender norms, male identity, stereotypes of "
"masculinity and  acceptability of violence. The Ministry of Social Policy, the Ministry of Interior, "
the Prosecutor’s General Office and the Court System must harmonize their collecting and 
reporting methodologies with clearly defined and non -interchangeable terminology t o this 
effect.  
• The legal and institutional framework must be strengthened. This includes ratification of the 
"Istanbul Convention, the definition of sexual harassment provided in art.1 of the Law of "
Ukraine No. 2866 -IV “On ensuring equal rights and opportu nities for women and men” to 
"cover horizontal and vertical sexual harassment, and the ratification of the Violence and "
"Harassment Convention, 2019 (No.190) to address work -related GBV  and the nexus "
between DV and access to decent work.  
• Coordination of the designated duty bearers must be implemented in accordance with the 
"Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers No.658  of 2018, and other relevant legislation. This must "
be linked with the commitment on the part of the authorities to regularly monitor progress 
and r eview the efficacy of laws and policies.  
"• Confidential, non -judgmental non -discriminatory and an easily available national, "
"subnational and local referral mechanism for victims/survivors, including those in conflict "
areas must be available. They are critica l to effectively respond to GBV under conditions of 
decentralization and legislative changes on social service provision and reduce further 
traumatization and victimization.  
"• Referral mechanisms must include operational hotlines, remotely accessible and sa fe "
"support and reporting mechanisms, the provision of safe spaces for GBV victims/survivors "
"(sexual GB V in particular) and those at risk, medical assistance from doctors with relevant "
"training and guidelines, shelters and social housing, health services in cluding sexual and "
"reproductive health, specialized counselling, psychological support services, longer -term "
rehabilitation and livelihood support.  
"• Victims/survivors must be legally empowered through information about their rights, legal "
procedures and pro tection mechanisms. They must have access to government provided 
"free and timely legal aid, reparation, mechanisms to resolve violence -inducing disputes and "
access to human -rights based and survivor -centered justice that places the burden of proof 
on the p erpetrators in civic cases.  
"• Women, men, girls  and boys must be made better aware about available support services, "
"including ways to enter / re -enter the labour market where applicable, through easily "
accessible websites and long -term public information campaigns that also reach those with 
limited or  no internet connection.  
• Support services for perpetrators must be made available and improved together with 
rehabilitation mechanisms for military personnel and civilians having experienced conflict.  
• The Ministry of Defence and Ministry of Interior must ensure soldiers are trained on the issue 
of sexual exploitation and abuse and apply zero tolerance for soldiers who commit crimes of 
a sexual nature.  
• Relevant state authorities and stakeholders require capacity building in form of qualified 
"personnel, incl uding first responder and law enforcement training that facilitates early "
"detection and intervention, and financial resources to conduct their key role in implementing "
"and monitoring GBV, IPV, DV and SV policy and legal frameworks.  "
"• Well-targeted, long -term information and awareness campaigns targeting both rights holders "
and duty bearers are needed to promote gender equality throughout society and state 
 
 
         
  
4 
"institutions, to eliminate discriminatory policies and practices, discriminatory beliefs and the "
"negativ e effects of socially constructed gender roles, and to promote zero -tolerance attitudes "
and practices.  
• Information about gender equality and violence against women and girls needs to be 
mainstreamed into the education system and training programs for teach ers and other 
education professionals. This needs to be complimented by community -based awareness 
"activities that encourage public response to incidences, and actions dedicated to "
empowering women and girls.  
"• GBV should be taken into consideration in econom ic development policies. For example, "
"Land Reform policies in relation to control over productive resources, in this case access to "
"agricultural land, is one of the causes for increased violence.  "

 GENDER -BASED VIOLENCE IN UKRAINE  
"Secondary Data Review, 27 April 2022  "
 
CRISIS OVERVIEW  
 
"The Russian military invasion on February 24, 2022 came as a shock to the country "
"and the world ( CARE, 2022 ) and is causing significant risks  (including risk of GBV)  "
to the affected population in Ukraine . The Ombudsman and Ministry of Inte rior of 
Ukraine reported cases of rape and sexual violence in non -government -controlled 
"areas. Human Rights Watch documented ""apparent war crimes"", including rape, in "
"Russia -controlled areas, and local officials in Bucha (Kyiv oblast) reported the "
discover y of a mass grave of civilians allegedly killed by Russian troops. The UN 
Secretary -General and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for an 
"independent investigation of these reports  (UNFPA, April 5, 2022).  After eight "
"years of armed conflict  – stemming from Russia’s invasion of Crimea in 2014 -, the "
"resulting humanitarian crisis in Ukr aine has become protracted ( OCHA, 2022 ). With "
"the February 2022 invasion, Ukraine is rapidly emerging as one of the world’s most "
"complex eme rgencies  ( ICG, April 5, 2022 ).   "
 
"Ukraine had made substantive gains on women’s rights in recent years, with a "
developing state -level ‘gender machinery’  (See refer to relevant sections of this 
report for detail) . These reforms were successful in contributing to the 
establishment of GBV res ponse services in Ukraine  with an investment of 200 
"million UAH from the Government committed to opening of shelters, crisis rooms "
"and psychosocial support  mobile teams for GBV in 2021 . Prior to the invasion, these "
gains were already under threat from deep ly entrenched and persistent gender 
"and discriminat ory-based inequalities, eight years of conflict in the east of the "
"country, and the gendered social and economic stress wrought by the COVID -19 "
"pandemic. This current crisis, with mass displacement inside and outside Ukraine, "
will add to that complex situation and put pressure on any gains that have been 
"made ( CARE, 2022 ). "
Women’s groups and c ivil society organizations  (CSOs) have been quick to react to 
"the immediate priorities of their communities, but face many challenges as they attempt to provide support to large numbers of internally displaced people, host -"
"communities and those directly affected by violence and ins ecurity ( UN Women, "
2022 ). UNFPA has continued its service provision and preventive work without 
interruption.  
"Multiple forms of GBV are being reported, with particularly high insecurity and risk "
"for women and girls on the move, at border crossing points and transit/collective "
"centers, and in bomb shelters. This includes reports of intimate partner violence, "
"sexual exploitation a nd abuse, sexual harassment, sexual violence (including "
"conflict -related sexual violence), and economic abuse. There is a high risk of "
"trafficking for sexual exploitation at borders where registration is patchy , little "
"control of documents,  and young women  are often not accompanied by other "
"family member s. In some cases, volunteers may offer accommodation and "
"transportation without vetting. Those who are traveling with children, who are "
"pregnant, living with disabilities, or older persons may remain behind in vulnerable "
circumstances including volatile militarized locations and face life -threatening 
"risks. Importantly, violence is taking place where GBV risk mitigation measures "
"should be in place, such as collective centers and bomb shelters (GBV AoR, April 1, "
2022) . Conflict -related sexual violence is being reported in war -affected militarized 
"areas with Human Rights Watch re porting  cases of rape in Kharkiv ( HRW, April 3, "
2022)  and The Guardian  highlighting that  women across Ukraine are grappling with 
the threat of rape as a weapon of war as growing evidence o f sexual violence 
"emerges from de-occupied areas.  (The Guardian, April 3, 2022) .Within Ukraine "
"more than 7 million people have been disp laced internally since February 24, 2022, "
and over 12 million have been affected in the areas hardest hit by the war and are 
"believed to be in need of assistance ( OCHA, March – May 2022  and IOM, April 1, "
"2022 ). 59% are believed to be female ( IOM, April 1, 2022 ). In addition, by the 30 of "
"March , UNHCR  estimated that there were over 4 million refugees, making this the "
"fastest growing refugee crisis since World War II ( UNHCR, March 24, 2022 ).    "
This is a profoundly gendered and intersectional crisis. Under martial law in 
"Ukraine, men aged 18 to 60 have to stay in the country and remain available for "
 
2 
 GENDER -BASED VIOLENCE IN UKRAINE  
"Secondary Data Review, 27 April 2022  "
 
"military conscription ( Deutsche Welle, 2022 ). The vast majority of refugees fleeing "
the country are women and children - believed to be 90% ( UN website ) - including 
"minoritized  women and children such as Roma ( Deutsche Welle, 2022 ). There are "
"challenges for members of vulnerable groups, for example, the LGBTI+ community, "
"including trans and non -binary people, wh ose gender according to their legal "
documents becomes a deciding factor in whether they remain in Ukraine or have 
"the scope to flee the country ( OHCHR, March 22, 2022 ). "
"Humanitarian needs within Ukraine, and in destination countries, are increasing "
"exponentially. Many people remain trapped in areas of escalating conflict and, "
"with essential services disrupted, are unabl e to meet their basic needs including "
"food, water and medicines. The delivery of lifesaving aid remains challenging, with "
"a lack of safe humanitarian access ( UNHCR, March 24, 2022 ; OCHA, March 28, "
2022 ). 
 
KEY TAKEAWAYS  
 
Women and girls in Ukraine need urgent action to prevent GBV and respond to its 
life-threatenin g consequences. Two thirds of women in Ukraine had experienced 
some form of GBV in their lifetime before the war began  (OSCE 2018 ); the 
deterioration of the security context has sharply increased the risk of multiple 
"forms of violence – including conflict -related sexual violence, sexual exploitation "
"and abuse (SEA) and trafficking in persons (GBV AoR, April 1 2022). The numbers "
of pe ople in need including internally displaced people and refugees increase daily 
"(UNHCR, 2022 ).  "
 
 
 ● Key pr iorities  
● The GBV subcluster continues to support GBV specialized actors to 
"provide comprehensive GBV response services (GBV case management, "
psychosocial support) and access to leg al aid for GBV survivors.  
"● Coordinating with UN actors, local and international health actors to "
ensure that the full package of lifesaving GBV and SRHR services and 
supplies guided by the Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP) for Sexual 
and Reproductive Health (SRH) in crisis situ ations are available to women 
and girls in Ukraine (including IDPs) and Ukrainians who have left the 
country. This includes updating the presently fragmented referral 
pathways.  
● Rebuilding GBV referral pathways  where these have been broken or 
disrupted to help survivors access support services which meet their 
"range of needs (eg. GBV case management, PSS, CMR, legal advice and "
"counselling , etc.)  "
 
"● Ensure continuous support to 30 shelters, crisis rooms and daily care "
centers  that remain operational across Ukraine for gender -based 
violence survivors.  
● Ensure continuous support to two national hotlines  for survivors of 
gender -based violence operating 24 /7 in Ukraine.  
"● Ensure continuous support to mobile psychosocial health teams,  staffed "
"by 48 trained psychologists and social workers, deployed to 12 regions in "
Ukraine . 
"● Engaging with and supporting Ukrainian women leaders , mediators, and "
organizations  and representatives  of vulnerable groups like Disability 
"Rights Organizations  and the Roma community, as well as pregnant "
"women, networks of women living with HIV, sex workers, and lesbian, "
 
3 
 GENDER -BASED VIOLENCE IN UKRAINE  
"Secondary Data Review, 27 April 2022  "
 
"bisexual, queer, trans and non -binary women to understand the nee ds "
"identified by them, to increase their influence in making humanitarian "
decisions in and for their communities and support their efforts.  
● Coordinating with Ukrainian national G overnment and local 
Government and providing  them with  GBV technical capacity  support  to 
enable life -saving service provision to survivors. This includes working to 
ensure prosecutors and police are applying a survivor centered approach 
to investigations and prosecutions.   
● Integrating GBV risk mitigation as a priority across the humanitarian 
response.  All sectors should apply the Guidelines for Integrating Gender -
"Based Violence Interventions in Humanitarian Action ( IASC, 2015 ) across "
"and throughout the response including collective cent ers, border "
crossings and the delivery of humanitarian assistance in areas affected by 
military operations . Given the specific GBV and SEA risks to women and 
girls highlighted in this report GBV ris k analysis and GBV risk mitigation 
measures should be applied to humanitarian cash transfer programming  
as a priority  and as routine . The Gender -Based Violence (GBV) Sub -
Cluster/Working Groups and Cash Working Groups in Ukraine and 
Moldova have outlined the key considerations for women and girls in 
"relation to cash in Ukraine and the regional response. (UNFPA,  March  29, "
2022).  
"● Engaging with and supporting Ukrainian women leaders , mediators, and "
organizations and representatives with GBV r isk mitigation and 
prevention efforts.  Women’s Rights Organizations have a key role to play 
in disseminating information on risks and GBV services available within 
Ukraine and across borders into neighboring countries.  
● GBV coordination mechanisms in Ukraine and neighboring refugee host 
countries working closely together to prevent and respond to GBV.  ● Partnering with civil society organizations in neighboring countries to 
document rights violations related to gender -based  violence  among 
refugees and assisting with referrals to national services.  
"● Collecting relevant and appropriate demographic data on GBV,  as the "
situation permits:  The priority at this time should be the delivery of life 
saving and life sustaining GBV respo nse services to GBV survivors.  As the 
"situation permits c ollecting gender, age, race/ethnicity and disability data  "
through the provision of GBV response services with the informed 
consent/assent of women and girls will be important to inform  the 
humanitarian response meets the specific needs of women and girls in all 
their diversity   
"(UN Women, 2022 ; CARE, 2022 ; CARE and UN Women , 2022 ; GBV AoR, April 1, "
"2022 , UNFPA,  April 19, 2022 ).  "
 
● Key geographic areas  
Overall:  As stated above IDPs are travelling to border areas to attempt to cross -
over into neighboring countries to seek refuge.  
"OHCHR reports 1,670 civilian casualties since the invasion. Additionally, with the "
"mass displacement of people within and outside Ukra ine since 24 February, the  "
growing needs remain difficult to assess and effectively address amid a highly 
"volatile security situation  (OCHA, 28 March 2022 ).  "
"Occupied areas, shifting control areas: the conflict is evolving and has been "
described by Ukraine’s President Chief of Staff as entering a ‘second phase’ as of 
"18 March 2022 (Reuters , March, 18, 2022 ).  Areas that were occupied by Russia in "
‘phase one’ but which have now reverted to Ukrainian state control have been 
"widely reported by media as ‘deva stated’, contaminated  and with surviving "
populations experiencing trauma and with reports of rape . Mass graves have been 
 
4 
 GENDER -BASED VIOLENCE IN UKRAINE  
"Secondary Data Review, 27 April 2022  "
 
identified and  recent autopsies are revealing  evidence of rape prior to being killed 
"in areas North of Kyiv .  (The Guardian, April 25, 2022 ). "
"Donetsk and Luhansk: For more than 8 years, conflict, movement restrictions and "
latterly the COVID -19 pandemic have been interlinked drivers of humanitarian 
needs in the war-affected areas of Donetska and Luhanska  oblasts. Humanitarian 
needs arising from the armed conflict remain critical on both sides of the “contact 
line” - the 427 -km frontline which divides Donetska and Luhanska oblasts into 
areas under Government control (GCA) and those outside it (NGCA  meaning  non-
government controlled areas ). With the “contact line” substantially closed since 
"March 2020, the NGCA population has struggled to access basic services, social "
"benefits and entitlements, for which they need to cross to GCA. Among the most "
"affected are  older persons living in NGCA, particularly women , as the effective "
closure greatly restricted their access to their pensions in GCA. Before the Russian 
invasion 30% of people in need of humanitarian assistance were older than 60 
"years of age. The majority  (59%) of the people in need live in NGCA ( OCHA, "
February 2022 ). Post -invasion needs remain severe and continue to deteriorate 
"(OCHA, 28 March 2022 ).  Civilia n populations are fleeing as conflict becomes "
proximal to them.  There are also reports of civilians becoming t rapped (for 
example in the extensively reported siege in Mariupol) and at risk of violence 
including conflict related sexual violence and other forms of GBV.  (UN Security 
"Council, SC/14834, 17 March 2022) . "
The western part of Ukraine: IDPs are gathering in  Lviv and other areas close to 
"borders, including while waiting to transit. UNHCR started enroll ing IDPs for its "
program in Lviv on the 17th March and will progressively expand to other cities 
"and regions (UNHCR, 18th of March, 2022 ). "
 
 
 ● Key vulnerable groups  
Particularly vulnerable groups due to the current crisis are:  
● Women and adolescent girls and boys that are trapped in areas with 
ongoing military operations that experienced /are under the high risk of 
sexual violence and other abuses  
● Survivors of sexual violence that have no access to life -saving services 
including CMR  
● Older women and people with disabilities who are still in Ukraine because 
"of immobility, and who are at risk of sexual  violence  and GBV including "
from military and armed actors . 
● Women in Ukraine experiencing domestic violence.  
● Pregnant and lactating women.  
● Women supporting the Ukrainian response as soldiers /armed actors  
(some of whom may become PoW) and health workers who are 
vulnerable to attacks .   
"● Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) , female headed households  that are "
on the m ove and at high risk of GBV . 
"● LGBTI+ people who experience harassment from armed actors , with trans "
people being denied passage out of Ukraine because of a lack of papers.  
● Women and g irls who are at risk of sexual exploitation and survival sex.  
● Non-Ukrainians e.g. students and migrants especially black and minority 
ethnic non -nationals facing harassment  and discrimination at borders . 
● Women who use drugs who are struggling to access treatme nt and 
support.  
● Women and girls who are HIV+ or with AIDS who are struggling to access 
medication treatment and support.  
"● Ukrainians  who have fled to Poland, Romania, Hungary, Moldova, "
"Slovakia, Belarus and elsewhere, who are almost all women and children "
"and at risk of GBV, sexual exploitation  and trafficking.  "

More information on key vulnerable groups and references are provided in the 
section below on the socio -demographic environment.  
 
LEGAL SYSTEM AND JUS TICE  
 
Rule of law: In 2014 the Ukrainian government embarked on an ambitious reform 
of the judiciary. Hundreds of judges resigned in response to the introduction of 
performance reviews and compulsory assets declarations in 2017.  The Supreme 
"Court was restructured in the same year, all its judges were dismissed,  and new "
appointments were made through a transparent selection process. The High Anti -
"Corruption Court was launched in September 2019  (Chatham House, 2019 ). "
"However, Ukraine’s flawed judicial system has been the ‘Achilles heel’ of the "
"country’s reform efforts ( Halushka and Shevchuck, 2021 ). The 2021 Rule of Law "
"Index ranked Ukraine 74/139, with the country below the regional average on "
"measures including absence of corruption, regulatory enforcement, and  civil and "
"criminal justice ( World Justice Project, 2021 ). "
CEDAW: Ukraine ratified CEDAW in March 1981 and since then has submitted 8 
periodic reports of the impleme ntation of the Convention.  
Women’s rights: Laws and national policies in place to protect women and girls:  
● In 2017 Ukraine adopted the Law on Preventing and Combating Domestic 
"Violence (Domestic Violence Law), as well as the Law on Amending the "
Criminal Code and Criminal Procedure to implement provisions of the 
Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Com bating Violence 
"against Women and Domestic Violence (Istanbul Convention). Given that these legal changes are recent, their application in practice is not yet "
"widespread or wholly consistent ( Mann and Gugaiets, 2020) . "
● Act on Combating Trafficking in Persons adopted in 2011.  
● National Plan of Action for the implementation of Security Council 
Resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and security (2016 -2020)  
"and on 28 October 2020 , a new National Action Plan for the period up to "
"2025 was approved . (OSCE, March 2021 ). "
● The Strategy for Prevention of and Response to the Conflict Related 
Sexual Violence in Ukraine was developed with the technical and financial 
support of the UN Women Ukraine and UN Human Rights Monitoring 
Mission in Ukraine in consultation with the Office of the Deputy Prime 
"Minister on European and Euro -Atlantic Integration, Ministry of For eign "
"Affairs and Ministry of Justice of Ukraine ( UN Women, 2018 ).  "
● National strategy on human rights and the action plan for its 
implementation (2016).  
Accompanying program s have also been developed including the Program on the 
Equality of Rights and Opportunities between Men and Women (2017 -2021 and 
"the State target program to combat trafficking, in 2016 ( CEDAW, 2017 ). "
There has been progress on implementing the legal framework for GBV including 
"the introduction of emergency protection orders and shelters, and special police "
"units trained to address situations of domestic violence (Amnesty International, "
"2020 ). Ukraine has yet to advance further to ensure a consistent victim -centered , "
human rights -based app roach in line with the requirements of the Istanbul 
"Convention, CEDAW and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights "
"(ECtHR) ( Mann and Gugaiets,  2020;  Amnesty International, 2020 ).  "
"Laws protecting Roma w omen and girls:  In 2013, Ukraine adopted a Strategy and "
Plan of Action for the Protection and Integration of the Roma National Minority 
into Ukrainian Society. Neither of these addresses gender issues or the needs of 
"Roma women and girls ( CARE, 2022 ). "

 GENDER -BASED VIOLENCE IN UKRAINE  
"Secondary Data Review, 27 April 2022  "
 
Definition of sexual violence/rape in Ukrainian  law:  Article 152 of the Criminal 
"Code of Ukraine, defines rape as ‘ Sexual activities involving vaginal, anal or oral "
penetration into the other person’s body with the use of genitals or any other 
"items, committed without voluntary consent of the victim .’ It includes such acts "
against a spouse. Article 153 defines sexual violence as ‘Commit ting any sexual 
violence not involving the penetration of another person's body without the 
voluntary consent of the victim’. Article 154 defines ‘Compulsion to engage in 
sexual intercourse’ as ‘Coercing an individual without his/her voluntary consent 
into a sexual activity with another person’. Article 155 regards ‘Sexual intercourse 
"with a person who has not reached the age of sixteen’ committed by an adult, and "
Article 156 on ‘Debauchery of minors’ concerns debauched actions committed in 
"relation to a pe rson under 16 years of age. All are punishable by imprisonment, "
"with terms depending on factors such as the age of the victim, relationship, "
"frequency of the crime, number of perpetrators, and other factors ( OHCHR, 2019 ).  "
"Data available for rape s reported, prosecuted,  and sanctioned in Ukraine in 2018 "
and 2019:

*The meaning of the term «rape» was changed by Law № 409 -IX of 06.12.2017 
"(came into force 11.01.2019). Source: OHCHR, 2019  Marriage laws: In 2012 the Family Code of Ukraine was amended to raise the "
minimum age for marriage for girls from 17 to 18; the minimum age for boys was 
"already set at 18. However, a court may grant permission for a person aged 16 "
years or older to marry if it is established that the marriage is in her or his interests 
(Article 23). Sexual intercourse and other activities of a sexual nature wi th persons 
"under 16 years of age are illegal under Articles 155 and 156 of the Criminal Code, "
"punishable by deprivation of liberty for up to five years ( UNF PA, undated ). "
"According to Family Code of Ukraine (Article 6), ‘a child is a person aged under 18, "
when majority is attained’. An adolescent marrying before the age of 18 
"immediately acquires full civil capacity ( UNFPA,  undated ). "
"A marriage must be registered at a state civil registry office, and religious marriages "
"and cohabiting couples have no legal status ( UNFPA, undated ). "
"Under Ukrainian law, marriage is a family union of a woman and a man. Currently "
"Ukraine does not officially recognize  same -sex spouses ( Suleymanova, Moroz and "
"Gubin, 2020 ). "
Divorce  is allowed. The formal grounds for divorce are:  
● Breakdown of the marriage.  
● Breakdown of common housekeeping (when the spouses are no longer 
living together as husband and wife).  
● Failure of one of the spouses to perform marital rights and obligations 
towar ds the other.  
● Physical or moral harm toward the other spouse or the children .  
"(Suleymanova, Moroz and Gubin, 2020 ). "
"Housing, land, and property rights: There is no legal discrimination regarding "
"inheritance rights . Regarding land, property and other non -land assets, the legal "
framework provides married and unmarried women with the same rights as 
"married and unmarried men to ownership, use, decision -making and use as "

 GENDER -BASED VIOLENCE IN UKRAINE  
"Secondary Data Review, 27 April 2022  "
 
"collateral including after divorce or separation.  However, rural women face "
"increased poverty, especially in conflict -affected areas where their rights to "
"productivity, livelihood and access to land are regularly violated and they face the "
"destruction and looting of property ( OECD, 2019 ). "
Documentation: Many of the Roma population in Ukraine lack civil status 
"documents, creating difficulties in accessing education, employment and health "
services. About 55.6% of Roma who were internally displaced in 2017 who were 
"interviewed by the Roma Women Fund, Chiricli, were not registered, which limited "
"their access to humanitarian assistance ( Chiricli, 2017 , cited in CARE, 2022 ).  "
Access to justice:  The legal framework for addressing domestic violence in Ukraine 
remains relatively new and is still evolving. Relevant stakeholders throughout the 
system have new competencies and standards to apply in a  novel domain (Mann 
"and Bugaiets, 2020 ). The 2018 Strategy for Prevention of and Response to the "
Conflict Related Sexual Violence in Ukraine is also relatively new. It states that the 
existing legal system was not suited to prosecute the different types of conflict 
"related sexual violence and was not adapted to the situation of conflic t (UNFPA, "
2018 ).  
"Several legal and operational gaps result in limited, if any, actual protection for "
survivors for GBV. Interagency coordination and cooperation in address ing 
"individual cases remains weak and largely unstructured ( Mann and Bugaiets, "
2020 ). Reporting GBV of any type is considered a taboo and not many women 
"access the justice sys tem when they experience violence  (OSCE et al, 2019 ). "
COVID -19 restrictions exacerbated instances of domestic violence yet undermined 
reporting. GBV cases are also less likely to be reported in conflict areas due to 
"military presence, a lack of security, the absence  or erosion of the rule of law and "
the pervasiveness of actual or perceived impunity of the perpetrators ( Amnesty 
"International, 2020 ). It is not clear how or if the justice  system is functioning since the February 24, 2022 "
"invasion. However, on March 22, 2022, Ukraine’s attorney general, Iryna "
"Venediktova, announced the first rape charges aga inst a Russian soldier "
"(Venediktova, 2022 , also Hollowood, 2022 ).   "
Access to police: A hotline survey conducted among victims of domestic violence 
"and other forms of violence against women, regarding their experience in "
"litigation, found that 61% reported the incident to the police of which 38% said "
"that they did not think it would help; 15% did not trust the police ( Watson et al, "
2019 ). Earlier UNFPA report s found that 1 in 10 women who experi ence violence 
"seek help  and two -thirds have never sought assistance . (UNFPA, 2018 , UNFPA "
2016 ). 
Ukraine’s legislation gives police officers the authority to issue so -called 
"emergency protection orders, which prohibit alleged perpetrators from entering "
"and staying on the premises a survivor may reside in, and from contacting the "
"survivor for 10 days. These powe rs are rarely enacted and if they are, are not "
"effectively enforced ( Amnesty International, 2020 ). "
A recent March 2022 UN Wom en report indicates that women’s access to police 
has been impacted by the current crisis. “There is no reaction from the police to 
"cases of domestic violence, we called – the application was not accepted.” – "
"Representative from local CSO. “The work of the  police is now reoriented, so cases "
of gender – based violence remain out of focus.” – Representative from local CSO . 
"(UN Wom en, 2022 ). "
"Standing in court:  In Ukraine, domestic violence falls both under administrative "
"and criminal legislation. Currently, unless a perpetrator has accrued two "
"administrative penalties for domestic violence, criminal prosecutions cannot be "
"initiated. In addition, members of the m ilitary and police are exempt from "
"administrative proceedings in courts of general jurisdiction, which effectively "
serves to protect them from criminal prosecution for domestic violence (Amn esty 
"International, 2020 ). "

Of 142 women who reported domesti c violence to the police (and participated in 
"the survey about domestic violence and experiences of litigation), 27 reported that "
"the case file had been submitted to court and 114 said it had not (Watson et al, "
2019 ).  
 
HEALTH SYSTEMS  
 
"Prior to the Russian invasion, in Eastern Ukraine aro und 1.5 million people needed "
"healthcare assistance  (Health Cluster Ukraine, December 2021),  with access to "
facilities restricted because of active hostilities and landmine contamination. The 
insecurity and curtailed access to referral hospitals and pharmacies have 
undermined the health care system’s ability to cope with both new and preexisting 
"health care needs, especially for people living in rural  areas. Conflict -affected "
people living along the contact line often faced barriers in access to healthcare 
"such as distance, cost of travel, cost and availability of medication, availability of "
"medical personnel, and limited accessibility of ambulances du e to the security "
situation. Persons with disabilities and GBV survivors have been particularly 
"affected by lack of access to health services ( Protection Cluster Ukraine, 2019 ).  "
The disrepair of health facilities because of the lack of resources for maintenance 
"also limits their functionality, particularly in rural conflict -affected areas. The "
fourth wave of  COVID -19 infections in GCAs and NGCAs since December 2021 has 
"added to the strain on health services in the area ( ACAPS, 2022 ). Violations of "
healthcare workers’ rights (83% of whom are women) led to a shortage of 
healthcare staff in Ukraine which has also negatively affected the right to health of 
"the general population ( OCHA, 2022 ). "
"Since the invasion of February 24, 2022, the health system is collapsing and access "
to essential health services including sexual and reproductive health care is 
"drastically r educed in those parts of Ukraine that are under severe attack, and is acutely jeopardized in other parts of the country . (UNFPA press conference, "
"March, 10, 2022 ). "
Verified attacks on health -care facilities have risen to the rate of 2 -3 per day (for 
"up to date statistics on the numbers of health facilities affected, see the WHO "
"Surveillance System for attacks  on health care (SSA) ), meaning that already "
"stretched healthcare services, including for sexual and reproductive health and "
"clinical management of rape, have even less capacity to respond to sexual violence "
"or to effectively refer to law enforcement bodie s (GBV AoR, April 1, 2022).  "
Many NGOs working on sexual and reproductive health rights ( SRHR ) in the region 
"and beyond are con cerned that In Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia a range "
of pre -existing legal and policy restrictions on SRHR and cost -barrie rs are severely 
impeding access to urgent and essential sexual and reproductive health care for 
"those fleeing Ukraine  (Amnesty International et al, 2022 ). "
Clinical Management of Rape Protocols:  The 2018 Strategy  for Prevention of and 
Response to the Conflict Related Sexual Violence in Ukraine references WHO’s 
"clinical management guidelines for rape survivors. Additionally, there is the Order "
of the Ministry of Health on the Identification and Treatment of domestic violence 
(this contains a protocol for CMR for cases where th is is applicable) . The Inter -
ministerial Order of Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Health on sharing 
"information regarding clinical trauma cases, obliges health care institutions to "
inform National Police on traumas/wounds etc. that could be presumed a s the 
"result of a criminal offence being committed  (Ministry of Health, February 1, 2019 ; "
"Anishchenko et. Al, April 2021 ).  Treatment is to be provided in any case and "
registration of criminal cases is not required.   CMR is presently available within 
Ukraine a nd sexual violence survivors are receiving treatment where there can 
"reach these services (UNFPA, 1 April 2022) . "
GBV -related services including state -run services:  The C ouncil of Europe’s project 
“Combating Violence against Women and Children in Ukraine” (carried out in line 
with the priorities laid out in the Council of Europe Action Plan for Ukraine for

 GENDER -BASED VIOLENCE IN UKRAINE  
"Secondary Data Review, 27 April 2022  "
 
"2015 -2017), foresaw the provision of expertise for the setting up a nd running of "
shelters and/or other specialized services for survivors of violence against women 
"and domestic violence in Ukraine by 2021 ( Council of Europe, 2018 ). However as "
"already s tated Ukraine has yet to ensure a consistent victim -centered , human "
"rights -based approach ( Mann and Gugaiets,  2020;  Amnesty International, 2020 ). "
UNFPA and NGOs have also supported GBV response and prevention program s and 
"established accessible and highly specialized  services for survivors, including "
"shelter, crisis rooms, daycare centers , mobile police groups, national toll -free "
"hotlines, psychosocial support mobile team and health service delivery points "
"(UNFPA, 2022 ). In Ukraine day care centers are a drop -in facility where "
"psychosocial support plus other types of linked support are available. (GBV AoR, "
"April 26, 2022) In late 2020, UNFPA with the support of the UK Government "
established an online women ’s career hub “Break the Circle”. The hub aims to 
"develop the professional potential and financial capacity of women survivors , or "
"women at risk of GBV , to he lp them build their life free from violence. ( UNFPA, "
2022 ) 
"At the current time, GBV specialized  services continue to operate in a number of  "
"municipalities (including many of largest cities of Dnipro, Vinnytsia, Lviv, Odessa, "
"Uzhhorod), except those communities where active hostilities are taking place, "
though essential services are currently affected by significant gaps and limitations.  
More information on GBV services and their operation in -crisis is provided under 
the section on GBV capacities.  
 
SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC ENVIRONMENT  
 
Ukraine already has an unusual demographic population profile with many more 
women (54%) than men (46%). Gender is featuring as a key factor in this crisis since  
"most of the people fleeing conflict affected areas of Ukraine are women, girls and boys. Since  Martial Law was introduced on 24 February 2022, m en aged 18 to 60 "
years are remaining in Ukraine . Older people (both women and men) are fleeing 
the conflict -affected cities and leaving the country. This means the demographic 
profile of affected people is likely to be quite distinctive in terms of gender and age 
"depending on where people are located ( CARE, 2022 ). "
"LGBTI+ people: Victor Madrigal -Borloz, UN Independent Expert on protection from "
"violence and discrimination based on sexual orient ation and gender identity, "
expressed his deep concern about evidence being brought to his attention 
confirming that exposure to dangers faced by people who seek protection during 
this time is greatly exacerbated for those who identify as LGBTI and/or gende r-
"diverse.  “LGBTI and gender -diverse people are vulnerable to acts of stigmatization , "
"harassment and violence from both armed combatants and civilians, whether such "
"acts are opportunistically motivated, connected to larger social discriminatory "
"patterns, or the result of explicit, targeted political repression.[...] I lament that the "
military operation by the Russian Federation and the ensuing armed conflict will 
destroy decades of progress in the fight against discrimination and v iolence based 
"on sexual orientation and gender identity in law, in access to justice, and in public "
"policy, including the health, education, employment and housing sectors ” (OHCHR, "
"March 22, 2022 ). "
In Ukraine people are now allowed to change their gender marker without surgery 
and get a new birth certificate. Although there has been progress towards legal 
"gender recogni tion the process remains onerous, which has deterred many "
Ukrainians from updating their documents. Without  accurate gender markers on 
"their identification, transgender people are left vulnerable to discrimination when "
travelling or accessing healthcare an d aid. It appears also that transgender women 
"who are listed as 'male' in government documents, and transgender men and "
masculine -presenting women are seen as potential recruits and are not allowed to 
"leave Ukraine ( Burgess, 2022 ). "
Older people over 65  years represent 22% of the population. Older women are 
more marginalized  and economically vulnerable than older men with the gender

pay gap le ading to a gender pension gap (32% in 2018). Because the number of 
"women of retirement age is higher than men, women are more dependent on state "
"pension and social policy measures. ( HelpAge, 2018 ). 57% of IDPs are over 60 and  "
"58% of the non -displaced population ( IOM, April 1, 2022 ). "
"Gender, a ge, disability, displacement status  and other characteristics further "
affected access to employ ment and financial resources in the pre -war period and 
are likely to impact the socioeconomic situation of the citizens of Ukraine during 
the war.  
"Persons with disabilities: Pre the Russian invasion that started in February 2022, "
"there were approximately 2.8 million people with disabilities in Ukraine, more than "
"1 million of whom are women of working age. Only a third of them had a job, and "
all others were in need of employment. 65% of women with disabilities visit a 
"doctor less than once a year, 11% of th em practice self -treatment, and 76% have "
"no access to a gynecologist. Each year, the number of single mothers with children "
"with disabilities in Ukraine is increasing. In 2015, there were 154,000 single "
"mothers with children with disabilities in Ukraine, a nd in 2017, this figure rose to "
"160,000 (from a Parliamentary Hearings on the Prevention of and Addressing the "
Discriminations of Women from Vulnerable Social Groups - reported in UN Women 
"et al, 2019 ).  "
"The number of people with disabilities is expected to be growing, as anecdotal "
reports from women’s CSOs in the southeast regions tell of increasing numbers of 
"women, men,  and child amputees in hospitals. Due to the dangers and challenges "
"of the journey, c aregivers of older people and family members with disabilities "
are making impossible decisions between fleeing and staying to care for their 
family members.  
"Persons with disabilities, including children and older people, face challenges in "
accessing shelt er and are at high risk of abandonment and family separation. 
"Shelters in Kyiv are not accessible, and while others rush to safety, people with "
"physical impairments with limited mobility are left behind. Due to stigma around disability and the lack of spec ialized  services, adults and children with disabilities "
are often placed in institutions away from home. There are huge concerns about 
"their access to services and safety in the current context ( CARE and UN Women, "
2022 ). 
The Government of Ukraine is adopting measures to facilitate the cross -border 
"movement of the most at -risk people, including persons with disab ilities and "
"unaccompanied minors ( CARE and UN Women, 2022 ). "
The Roma population  faces ongoing discrimination . The last Census (2001) put the 
"number of Romani in Ukraine at 47,600. However, according to various estimates, "
"the Roma community comprises between 200,000 and 400,000 people living in all "
regions of the country. Despite the adoption of a Strategy and Pl an of Action for 
the Protection and Integration of the Roma National Minority into Ukrainian 
"Society, discrimination and violence against this group continue. Neither the "
"Strategy nor Plan of Action are gendered ( CARE, 2022 ) despite gender stereotypes "
"that are prevalent in the Roma community, where girls’ education is often not "
"encouraged ( CARE and UN Women, 2022 ). A report by Minority Rights Group "
Europe and the International Charitable Organizati on Roma Women’s Fund 
‘Chiricli’ (Chiricli) on the Roma in Ukraine noted the continuing discrimination and 
"violence against the group, including an example of men in uniforms attacking "
"Roma women and children at a square near the main railway station ( Bocheva, "
2019 ). 
Roma people have experienced discrimination  as they flee the current crisis; they 
not only face violence from the invading army but also from Ukrainian forces and 
from the states welcoming refugees. The break -up of families and loss of male 
breadwinners have hit Roma women particularly hard as they  tend to rely heavily 
"on men for support and protection. Because of their size, most Roma families have "
found it difficult to find accommodation in neighboring countries. In Moldova 
"there are reports that they are separated by authorities from ethnic Ukrai nians, in "
"an attempt to prevent tensions . (Popoviciu, March 7, 2022 ; Benstead, April 5, "
2022 ). 
 
11 
 GENDER -BASED VIOLENCE IN UKRAINE  
"Secondary Data Review, 27 April 2022  "
 
Significant numbers of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs)  pre-date the current 
crisis. As of 1 April 2021  there are more than 7 million people who have been 
"displaced internally.   59% are believed to be female, 5% infants, 57% are older than "
"60, 24% have a child under 5, 10% are IDPs from 2014 -2015 (with or without formal "
"status), 30% are chronically ill and 19% are living with a disability,  ( IOM, April 1, "
"2022 ) In addition, by the 30 of March UNHCR  estimated that there were over 4 "
"million refugees , making this the fastest growing refugee crisis since World War II "
"(UNHCR, March 24, 2022 ).    "
UN Women (March 2020) reported that internally displaced women face 
"discrimination in attempting to access economic resources, public services, and "
"decision -making processes. In the current conflict, there is a significant risk of "
"double or triple displaceme nt of those who were already displaced ( CARE, 2022 ). "
There is little sex disaggregated data on the humanitarian profile since the Russian 
invasion of February 2022. Available data includes:  
"● 59% of IDPs are female (from IOM survey, although absence of credible "
"sources of IDP data - IOM, April 1, 2022 ). "
● 90% of refugees are women and children ( UN website ). 
● Women of re productive age: 8% of IDPs are pregnant or breastfeeding 
"(IOM, 1 of April 2022 ). According to the United Nations Population  Fund, "
"about 1,000 deliveries among Ukrainians are expected per week. The "
"World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 15% of pregnancies, in "
"a war zone or not, will require skilled medical care for a potentially life -"
"threatening complication ( Levy, 2022 ). "
"Female headed households: in NGCA, 71% of heads of households are female. The "
"percentage is even higher for the population aged over 60, where the share of "
female -headed households is 88%. While women are more likely to head 
"households in the conflict -affected areas of Ukraine, they are also more likely to "
have multi -sectoral needs compared to men. The situation in NGCA is expected to 
"be si milar, but no reliable and consistent data are available ( OCHA, 2022 ).   Girls:  There are report s that adolescent girls are resorting to sur vival sex as a result "
of the impacts of conflict. Women and girls displaced by the war are at risk from 
sexual  exploitation and face sexual violence ( UNODC 2022 ).  
Pre the current conflict girls tended to rate their health twice as worse as boys – 
one in three girls consider their health to be ‘so -so or ‘poor.’ This is almost twice 
as high as the global ave rage and six times higher than in countries such as North 
"Macedonia. Every third adolescent reported feeling depressed, with girls more "
likely to report this ( UNICEF 2019 ). Roma girls face discrimination and lack access 
"to education compared to boys (Roma Women Fund - Chiricli, 2017 ).  "
People l iving with HIV: Ukraine has the second highest rates of HIV in Eastern 
"Europe and Central Asia, affecting about 1% of the population. There are 260,000 "
"people living with HIV in Ukraine, of which 120,000 are women over 15 years "
"(UNAIDS, 2021 ). In 2019 80% of people living with HIV who needed treatment were "
"taking ARVs ( UNAIDS, 2020 ).  "
"The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that at least 28,000 people "
"living with HIV will have fled Ukraine and need access to HIV treatment elsewhere, "
"including 14,589 men, 12,937 women, and 562 children. The overall number is "
"likely to rise to 40,000 if numbers of refugees increase as predicted ( AIDSMap, "
2022 ). 
People living in poverty ( Economy ): Ukraine is one of the poorest countries in 
Europe and Ukrainian women are more likely to receive social assistance than men. 
"UN Women (May 2020) citing data from the State Statistics Service reported that, "
"in 2018, women consti tuted 72.2% of those registered to receive social assistance "
"and 73% of applicants for in -kind aid and cash assistance. ( CARE, 2022 ).  "
Befor e the invasion the labor  market reflected gender inequalities. According to 
"the International Gender Gap Index Report 2020, Ukraine ranks 59th of 153 "
"countries ( 2020 ). Since 2014, the pay g ap between men and women has increased "
from 24% to 26% (International Gender Gap Index Report 2020 ). Only a small part 
 
12 
 GENDER -BASED VIOLENCE IN UKRAINE  
"Secondary Data Review, 27 April 2022  "
 
of the gender pay gap is thought to be as a result of the differences in endowments 
"(education, work experience, economic sector etc.) between men and women. "
Discriminatory practices may be underpin ned by discriminatory gender attitudes 
"(Gatskova, 2021 ). Female participation in the labor  market is 46.7% compared to "
"63.1% for men ( UNDP, 2020 ). "
"Injecting drug users : About 317,000 Ukrainians inject drugs like heroin regularly "
"(NAM AIDSmap, 2022 ). Women who use drugs are a particularly marginalized "
community; their social stigmatization as drug users is reinforced by their gender . 
Female drug users likewise face the discriminatory aspects of clause 164 of the 
"Family Code of Ukraine, which states that a person can b e deprived of his/her "
parental rights in case of alcohol or drug addiction which hampers  their 
"engagement in treatment/medical services ( AIDSFo nds et al, 2021 ).   "
"As of January, 14,868 of drug users were receiving substitute opiates such as "
methadone and buprenorphine.  Ukraine has been funding these treatment 
"services since 2017 (NAM AIDSmap, 2022 ). Over 80% of those prescribed "
treatment in Ukraine are men. This may reflect lower numbers of female d rug 
users but is also believed to be the result of the barriers women who use drugs 
face accessing services such as a potential risk that their children could be taken 
"away ( AIDSFonds et al, 2021 ).  "
"Since February 2022 of the two main manufacturers of methadone in Ukraine, one "
factory has been evacuated and stocks are empty in the other. The Russian 
"government is known for its hostility to tre atment for drug users, and supplies "
were cut off in Crimea when it was annexed in 2014. Discussions on how to transfer 
"methadone into Ukraine are ongoing ( NAM AIDSmap, 2022 ). "
Education: Ukraine has extremely high levels of literacy. UNESCO reports that 
women and men in Ukraine have almost 100% literacy. Ukraine has achieved 
gender parity in enrolment from the pre -primary u p to tertiary level of education 
(UNESCO website ). The greatest gender disparities in enrolment in educational institutions are seen in technical and vocational education. There are distinct 
"gender patterns in fields of study, with young women and men channeled  toward "
"certain academic subjects, women, for example, are more likely to study "
"healthcare and education ( State Statistics Service, 202 discussed in CARE, 2022 ).  "
Women’s Rights Organizations  exist in Ukraine and before the conflict were active 
throughout the country. The 2014 Maidan Revolution generated high levels of civic 
"activism, especially among young people using social media. Respondents to a UN "
Women (2020) study on the capacity of women’s organizations  and CSOs on 
gender equality and wom en’s rights in Ukraine noted that the greatest challenges 
to progress on gender equality and women’s rights are the lack of political and 
"public support, and the lack of resources. They identified organizations  focused on "
a range of themes including:  
● Econ omic and political equality  
● Gender -Based Violence  
● Women Peace and Security  
● Business leadership  
● Law reforms and policy advocacy  
● Poverty reduction  
● Women with disabilities  
● Sexual and reproductive health and rights  
● Roma women  
"● Lesbian, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer (LBTIQ) issues and "
rights  
"(UN Women, 2022 ). "

RESPONSE ENVIRONMENT (BASIC NEEDS)  
 
"Threat s to Life (Lack of safety and security) : Women and men, boys and girls "
across the country are facing unprecedented threats to their lives. Some people 
have fled their homes in search of safety and are struggling to find a roof over their 
heads and basic needs for their families. Others have no w ay to leave their 
"communities due to a lack of transport, proximity of military violence, or physical "
"mobility, among many other things. Many are seeking protection in nearby bomb "
"shelters, while others are unable to leave their home ( UN Women, 2022 ). "
Many CSOs highlight the constant fear that women are under for themselves and 
"their families. The psychological impact of threat,  insecurity and instability is "
"already taking a heavy toll on people, as they navigate the rapidly changing "
"environment ( UN W omen, 2022 ).  "
Protection: Pre the Russian invasion in February 2022 approximately 2.5 million 
"people, including 291,000 IDPs, were recorded as in need of specialized protection "
"responses. Over 909,000 were recorded as in need of child protection services, "
"with an additional 582,000 in need of GBV prevention and responses.  "
IDPs in Ukraine felt that local integration was the preferred durable solution. The 
main challenges around the protection of IDPs pre -invasion were related to de -
"linking access t o services and benefits from IDP registration, expanding access to "
"housing programs, promoting economic inclusion and finding solutions to IDPs still "
living in collective centers. These views of IDPs are not disaggregated by gender. In 
the NGCA GBV activit ies were still a major gap due to limitations imposed in the 
"NGCA, while core and fundamental protection services such as psychological "
"support, legal aid and individual counselling were still not available in the NGCA  "
"(OCHA, 2022 ).   "
Women participating in focus group discussions in settlements set up as a result of  
"the conflict in the East of Ukraine pre -Russian invasion in February 2022, explained the impact of a number of factors related to the security of women and girls, such "
as lack of street lighting; the presence of aggressive stray dogs; and the fear of 
"meet ing people under the influence of alcohol or drugs. In addition, women living "
0 to 5 km from the “contact line” reported as their main concerns the risk of being 
"robbed (17%), being injured (16%), being victim of Mines/ERW (12%), and being "
"killed (9%)  (OCHA, 2022 ). "
Child protection: One month of war in Ukraine has led to the displacement of 4.3 
"million children, more than half of the country’ s estimated 7.5 million child "
population. This includes more than 1.8 million children who have crossed into 
neighboring countries as refugees and 2.5 million who are now internally displaced 
"inside Ukraine. Despite intensive efforts to ensure safe, rapid and unimpeded "
"humanitarian access and child protection, significant challenges remain in the most "
"affected areas across the country. ( UNICEF, March 30, 2022 ) "
Women’s Rights Organizations : Local women’s groups and civil society 
organizations  (CSOs) are in need of support and funding to enable them to 
"continue to respond to the immediate priorities of their communities ( UN Women, "
2022 ). 
Food security: Over 20% of the population in Luhansk and 19% in Donetsk suffered 
from insufficient food consum ption levels pre the Russian invasion . Farmers and 
"workers are unable to access their workplaces or farms, and traders refrain from "
operating near the contact line given high insecurity levels. The limited access to 
income or income -generating activities a nd limited market functionality effect 
"people’s food security levels . Because of various movement limitations, food prices "
"are higher in NGCAs, meaning food insecurity is also higher in those areas than in "
"GCAs . (ACAPS, 2022 ). "
Most women’s organizations  that participated in UN Women’s study mentioned 
the acute need for basic life -sustaining support. This includes a specific call for food 
"(especially baby food), medicine/medical services and hygiene and sanitation "

"items (such as diapers). It is clear from requests by women’s CSOs, that women a re "
"highly concerned for their children . (UN Women, 2022 ). "
"Livelihoods: In the current crisis, Women’s Rights Organizations CSOs are reporting "
the rapid loss of income. Not only is the access to cash limited or suspended 
"(through for example ATMs), but people are not able to work and earn their "
"livelihoods. In some cases, those reliant on pensions or other social support, have "
"not been able to access their funds. At the same time prices are quickly increasing, "
as goods become increasingly unavailable and supply chains are halted ( UN 
"Women, 2022 ). "
"According to the Public Employment Centre, during the COVID -19 quarantine "
"period, women and men were equally receiving the unemployed status, but men "
"entered employment much more often than women ( OCHA, 2022 ). "
"Female pensioners, particularly those residing in NGCA, are reported to be in a "
particularly vulnerable situation. As women’s pensions were on average 30%  
"lower than those of men, the costs involved for crossing the “contact line” or "
transit through the Russian Federation to collect pension payments in GCA have a 
"higher negative economic impact on them ( OCHA, 2022 ). "
Increased economic challenges encountered by women compared with men put 
"them at higher risk of GBV, and becoming targets of sexual exploitation and "
"trafficking, particularly among the population affected by the conflict ( OCHA, "
2022 ). 
Meet basic needs of women and girls to mitigate and preve nt sexual exploitation 
including  survival sex: Since the start of the conflict in 2014 in the regions of 
"Donetsk and Luhansk, increasing numbers of women selling sex have been "
recorded. There are concerns that the current war may also impact the rates of s ex 
"work, as well as survival sex, as a negative coping mechanism particularly among "
women and adolescent girls in the severely war -affected settlements  ( CARE and 
"UN Women, 2022 ). Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene: Some areas report a lack of access to water and "
limited/no power supply or backup generators. This is particularly true for the 
"people staying in tempor ary sleeping arrangements, such as schools or ad -hoc "
"shelters ( UN Women, 2022 ).  "
"Health: Health statistics reveal that before  the conflict, Ukrainian women outlive "
men by about 10 years. This data trend is similar to  that observed in other East 
European countries but almost double that of Western Europe. The gap is 
"attributed, in part, to behavioral  differences with men smoking and/or drinking "
"alcohol more, working in unsafe jobs and not seeking treatment for health i ssues "
"(reported in FAO, 2021). COVID -19 vaccination rates are also lower than the "
"European average  (CARE, 2022 ). "
"In Ukraine in 2021 for wome n aged 15 -49, the contraceptive prevalence rate of "
"any method was 53%, while the unmet need for family planning rate was 6%. The "
maternal mortality ratio was 19 deaths per 100 000 live births in 2017. There are 
"no data available on sexual, reproductive and  maternal health interventions in "
"Donetska and Luhanska oblasts.  ( Health Cluster Ukraine, 2021 ).  "
"Women’s access to SRH R services already fell rapidly during COVID -19 ( CARE, "
"2022 ). Now the invasion is having a severe impact on women, girls and "
"marginalized  populations in Ukraine and is jeopardizing  their SRHR ( UN Women, "
"March, 29, 2022 ). The risk of maternal and infant mortality and morbidity will "
"increase rapidly in the coming months ( UNFPA website , 2022 ). Global standards "

"For Ukraine specifically, UNFPA estimates there were 265,000 pregnant Ukrainian "

 GENDER -BASED VIOLENCE IN UKRAINE  
"Secondary Data Review, 27 April 2022  "
 
"HIV treatment and care : As of 11 April 2022, UNAIDS estimates that there may "
only be a three -week supply of antiretroviral therapy (ART) left in Ukraine and 
many of those fleeing the conflict within Ukraine and into neighboring  countries 
are likely to experience difficulties in accessing regular supplies of the life -saving 
medicines. HIV prevention services have also been severely disrupted  ( UNAIDS  
"website , 2022 ). "
"According to the AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF), military assaults and "
bombings have forced the complete closure of its clinics in the eastern city of 
"Kharkiv and the seaport of Mariupol in the south. The NGO, which provided "
treatment to about one in thr ee people receiving antiretrovirals in Ukraine when 
"the war broke out, said Russian military incursions have also limited the work of "
"clinics in cities including Kherson, Mykolaiv, Severodonetsk, Slavyansk and Odessa "
"(Ryan, 2022 ). "
In order that people living with HIV who have been forced to leave Ukraine as a 
result of the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation can access ART and 
"other medical care, the Euro Guidelines in Central an d Eastern Europe (ECEE) "
Group has launched the ART Initiative for Ukrainians Abroad in coordination with 
the Center for Public Health of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine and the L.V. 
Gromashevsky Institute of Epidemiology and Infectious Diseases of the Na tional 
"Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine (IEIH) ( UNAIDS website , 2022 ). "
Trans and intersex care:  ILGA -Europe (the European branch of the Inte rnational 
Lesbian and Gay Alliance) has mapped urgent needs from trans and intersex people 
"in cities across Ukraine. There is a particular need for hormone therapy, as well as "
"syringes and needles. If donations of hormone therapy can be secured, ILGA -"
Europ e will work with WHO to try to include these in humanitarian aid packages 
"(NAM AIDSmap, 2022 ). "
"Shelter: There is a larg e shortage of safe accommodation, as many people have "
"been displaced and are on the move to safer locations ( UN Women, 2022 ). Inside "
"Ukraine, UNHCR has been delivering core relief items such as blankets, sleeping mats and emergency shel ters and authorities in neighboring countries have set up "
"temporary shelter for refugees. ( UNHCR, March 8, 2022 ). UNFPA covered basic "
hygienic needs o f women and girls by delivering dignity kits and essential packs to 
"the most vulnerable ( UNFPA, April 2022 ). There is lack of  disaggregated data on "
shelter needs. The section on GBV capabilities describes the impact of the conflict 
on the operation of shelters for GBV survivors.  
Camp Coordination and Camp Management  (CCCM) : Apart from a call to  ‘ensure 
"that all Cluster members apply in their work age -gender -diversity approach, work "
on prevention of SEA and implement accountability to affected populations 
"policies’ , the CCCM Cluster Ukraine’s strategic framework (CCCM Cluster, March, "
"17, 2022 ) has no other disaggregated or specific information relevant to women, "
girls and gender diverse people.  
"Education:  Disruption to education is impacting children, young people and their "
caregivers. The Education Cluster estimates that access to education for 5.7 million 
"children and adolescents is at risk. Although school education is resuming online, "
"many children and teachers, especially those displaced, may have difficulties "
"accessing classes due to the lack of computers, internet access, books and "
"stationery, as well as the lack of surroundings conducive to hours of studying. This "
will ultimately also have an impact on the family members and p articularly 
"mothers, who tend to take the main responsibility of home -schooling their "
"children. While now all children will face access challenges to education, Roma "
women and girls of all ages face particular challenges in accessing education 
"including ba rriers linked to poverty, gender stereotypes that devalue the education "
"of girls, a lack of future employment prospects and a lack of civil status "
"documentation . (CARE and UN Women, 2022 ). "
"Social services: CSOs highlight major gaps in service provision, including the lack of "
"childcare and education for children, which causes disruption for adults and "
children alike. Many CSOs emphasize how the suspension of social services 
"disproportionately affects different groups such as elderly women, women with "
"disabilities or single mothers ( UN Women, 2022 ). "
 
16 
 GENDER -BASED VIOLENCE IN UKRAINE  
"Secondary Data Review, 27 April 2022  "
 
Communication and Information: CSOs are drawing attention to the lack of 
information and poor communication lines. Women do not have access to the 
information they need to make informed dec isions and internet/phone 
connections in some locations are intermittent. This includes information on legal 
"aid, and how to navigate new complex systems of migration and access to social "
"and protection services ( UN Women, 2022 ). "
 
SOCIAL CULTURAL AND RELIGIOUS ENVIRONMENT  
 
GBV perception: 41% of Ukrainians surveyed disagree that 'If a man mistreats his 
"wife, others outside of the family should intervene'  and 43% agree . 19% agree that "
‘It is a wife’s obligation to have sex with her husband even if she doesn’t feel like it’  
and 71% disagree.  These statistics show that the Ukrainian population hold among 
"the most discriminatory views on gender in the region  (OSCE et al, 2019 ). However, "
63% disagree that domestic violence is a private matter which is one of the highest 
rates in the region. The 2012 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey ( MICS ) found that 
"only 2.9% of women, 9.4% of men  thought a husband was justified in hitting his "
"wife in 5 given circumstances.  ( UNICEF et a l, 2012 )  Later research in Ukraine also "
showed  that 10% of men surveyed agree d that women should tolerate domestic 
"violence to keep her family, and 32% o f the surveyed men reporting having  male "
friends who perpetrated physical violence against their wives or partners . This 
survey  also showed that 19% of men surveyed agreed with the view that when a 
"woman is raped  she usually did something to put herself in that situation . (UNFPA, "
"2018).  Conducted annually since March 2019, the UNFPA -led national study "
Omnibus captures a positive shift in perceptions and attitudes.  The 2021 study 
found that most common beliefs that condone GBV have been challenged. 5% 
"more people consider the statement ‘If he beats you, it means he loves you’ "
obsolete (reaching 87%). Anot her 5% more Ukrainians think that a woman should 
not tolerate violence to save the family (80%). The perception informs behavior 
"change. 5% more people state their willingness to intervene in a GBV incident to stop it (67%). Ukrainian society gradually gro ws more sensitive to GBV, "
disapproving its manifestations and offering support to survivors. There is an 
emerging recognition of GBV as a societal problem (rather than personal) that 
requires a consolidated response of the community. Changes in public perc eption 
and growing unacceptability of GBV also sends a powerful signal that Ukrainian 
"society expects due response to GBV. (UNFPA, April 2021) . "
Women in decision -making: Women report that they are being excluded from 
"important decision -making processes at all levels, whilst at the same time being "
"forced to play a critical role in the humanitarian response . (UN Women, 2022 ).  "
"“The war started on February 24, 2022 and once again it showed how much women "
are ignored at the level of coo rdination and making decisions. Their suggestions 
"and needs are ignored, and instead priority is given to the needs of Teroborona "
"(voluntary local defense group), mostly represented by men, who dictate what to "
do and how to behave. At the same time when it  comes to humanitarian needs of 
"IDPs, locals, and households – women do most of the work – they drive, provide "
"hospitals and locals with medication and food, they care about their disabled "
relatives and children. And this all remains unnoticed again and ag ain.” – 
"Representative from local CSO . (UN Women, 2022 ). "
"Before the current crisis, more women were participating in Ukrainia n decision -"
"making, but men still dominate politics and leadership positions. The percentage "
of women members of parliament in Ukraine increased from 2.7% in the 1990s to 
11.7% in 2014 and to 20.5% in 2019. A gender quota system for parliamentary 
"elections has been in place since 2014 and for local councils since 2015. However, "
the absence of financial and other supports for women candidates and of a quota 
"compliance mechanism, coupled with high levels of violence and abuse, including "
"cyber -bullying, against  women candidates, limited the impact of the system. In the "
"2020 local elections, women’s representation grew from 15.3% to 28%. This latter "
figure reflects increased representation of women in large towns and cities but a 
"drop of 12.6% on the local counci ls and 14.8% as settlement, village and city "
"mayors . (CARE, 2022 ). "
 
17 
 GENDER -BASED VIOLENCE IN UKRAINE  
"Secondary Data Review, 27 April 2022  "
 
"Ukrainian women leaders, mediators and organizations  have been extremely "
"active in efforts on women , peace and security with the launch of the 2020 "
"campaign ‘Women Are Key to Peace ’. (CARE, 2022 ). "
"Gender roles:  Gender roles are relatively rigid in Ukraine, however there are signs "
"this is changing ( Ellner, 2022 ). 80% of information technology students are males. "
"Women’s STEM attainment ( science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) "
"is 14% for women compared to 38% for men  (World Economic Forum, 2021 ). Only "
"3% of those who take paternity leave are men (fathers). ( UNFPA, 2021 ) Yet o ne in "
five fathers surveyed would like to take parental leave and 45% of Ukrainian 
"fathers said they would like to spend more time with their children.   (UNFPA, 2021)  "
51% of Ukrainians interviewed for a OSCE et al ( 2019 ) survey on the well -being and 
safety of women agreed with the statement that it is important for a man to show 
his wife/partner who the boss is.   
"Traditional marriage practices: In Roma communities, marriage often takes place "
"earlier than the legal age. (UNFPA, undated ).   "
Religious and legal practices: Nearly 80 % of Ukrainians are affiliated  with an 
"Orthodox denomination . Approximately 10% of the population, particularly in "
"western Ukraine, belong to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. Muslims, mostly "
"of Crimean Tatar heritage, comprise about one percent of Ukraine’s population, "
"along with a historically significant Jewish community numbering arou nd 200,000 "
"and small groups of Protestant Christians . (United States I nstitute for Peace, 2022 ).  "
"The head of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, wrote in November 2020 ‘Don’t be "
"silent, and don’t tolerate violence against yourself or your children’ on the website "
"Stop Violence. However, although religious leaders have called fo r an end to "
"domestic violence, they have allowed psychological harassment, the physical "
"‘upbringing’  or ‘admonishment’  of wives and children, and financial coercive "
control to continue . (Centre for East European and International Studies website ). The CEDAW Committee ( 2017 ) reports that women  in Ukraine face barriers in 
"accessing justice, notably due to corruption and lack of independence of the "
"judicial system, lack of knowledge of rights by women and limited availability of "
legal aid. See also the sub -section above on access to justice.

 GENDER -BASED VIOLENCE IN UKRAINE  
"Secondary Data Review, 27 April 2022  "
 
Prevalence before the February 2022 invasion of the different forms of intimate 
partner psychological violence:  
● Economic violence - 20% 
● Controlling behavior  - 55% 
● Abusive behavior  - 53% 
● Using your children to blackmail you or abusing your children - 12% 
"For all countries surveyed by OSCE et al (2019) in the region, sexual and physical "
violence was more common from previous partners  than a current one.  
"(All data above regarding types of violence is from OSCE et al, (2019 ) except where "
indicated. The OSCE carried out a survey with a sample representative of the adult 
"population of women (2,048 women , aged 18 –74), including 298 women living "
"close to the contact line in the Donetsk and  Luhansk regions, in an effort to better "
understand how conflict affects violence against women. The sample in Ukraine 
does not cover the Autonomous Republic of Crimea or non -government -controlled 
areas in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.)  
Domestic violenc e had already increased under COVID -19 before the most recent 
conflict  began . Some 10% of respondents survived incidents of domestic violence 
"before the quarantine, with half of them (56%) reporting worsening of domestic "
violence during COVID -19 restrictio ns. It is likely that GBV cases have been 
"significantly underreported while quarantine restrictions remained in place, since "
living with the perpetrators prevents women and girls from reporting incidents of 
violence.  GBV cases are also less likely to be r eported in conflict areas due to 
"military presence, a lack of security, the absence or erosion of the rule of law and "
the pervasiveness of actual or perceived impunity of the perpetrators. Women 
"generally report having a (misplaced) sense of shame and guil t, fear of further "
"victimization, a lack of financial independence, stigma within their community, and "
lack of awareness of how and where to seek help as the main obstacles preventing 
"them from reporting abuse and violence. ( OCHA, 2022 ). During situations of conflict and displacement, the risk of domestic violence tends "
"to increase dramatically. According to a 2020 Amnesty International report, "
Ukraine saw a severe increase in reports of domestic violence in separatist areas 
in 2018: 76% increase in the eastern region of Donetsk and 158% in Luhansk. 
"(Amnesty International, 2020 ). Among IDPs, the number of women and girls "
"surveyed by OSCE et . al, who reported having experienced GBV was three times "
"higher than local women who were not displaced . (OSCE et al, 2019 ). "
"In 2018, a baseline survey of conflict -affected older women and men in the "
government -controlled areas (GCAs) of Donetsk and Luhansk conducted by 
HelpAge International found that 20.5% of older people (75.8% of whom were 
women) experienced at least one type of violen ce and abuse. The most common 
"form of abuse was emotional/psychological abuse . (HelpAge, 2018 ).  "
"Between December 2019 and May 2021, the OSCE documented the receipt of "
"multiple reports of episodes of transactiona l sex, a form of sexual exploitation and "
"abuse, as a survival tactic . (OCHA, 2022 ). "
"For women in Ukraine, and those who have fled, there are  grave concerns about "
the risks of GBV from  non-partners.  
"Within Ukraine,  Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro -Atlantic "
"integration, Olha Stefa nishyna, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, and MP. Maria "
"Mezentseva,  are among those who have been vocal about the use of rape in the "
"current conflict. ( Venediktova, 2022  also Hollowood, 2022 ). There have been "
"strong allegations of conflict related sexual violence - for example, gang -rapes, "
"assaults taking place at gunpoint, and rapes committed in front of c hildren are "
among the grim testimonies collected by investigators (reported in the press by for 
"example Fo, 2022 , Duffy, 2022 ; McKernan, April 4th, 2022 ).  "
"Older women may also be vulnerable, as they are less mobile and may not be as "
able to flee as others.  Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko said Russian troops were 
"sexually abusing senior citizens on the outskirts of Kyiv, while speaking during a "
 
19

"Secondary Data Review, 27 April 2022  "
 
press briefing  in the UK. The abuse is happening to “the most vulnerable of the 
"vulnerable, ” she said . (Hollowood, 2022 ). "
Outside Ukraine:  There are serious concerns about the danger of sexual violence 
"and human trafficking for women and girls fleeing Ukraine. Dagmar Schumacher, "
"Director of the UN Women Brussels Office, stated on International Women’s Day, "
"‘The current situation jeopardizes  the safety of all people in Ukraine, but it also puts "
"women and girls at increased risk of sexual violence, especially those who are "
"refugees or otherwise displaced from their homes .’ (Walker and Lyons, 2022 ). The "
"Polish and German press include reports of rape, sexual violence and human "
"trafficking of women and girls fleeing Ukraine, and there are concerns about th e "
"dangers for Ukrainian women and girls elsewhere . (McGrath, 2022 ). "
Roma people and LGBTI+ people who are fl eeing are particularly vulnerable to 
"discriminatory attitudes in the countries they arrive in (Time, 2022 ). "
"Unaccompanied children are at high risk of abuse and trafficking (UNODC, 2022 ). "
 
GBV CONSEQUENCES  
 
OSCE et . al’s (2019) survey of GBV and its impacts found the following:  
Physical injuries arising from the most serious incident of physical and/or sexual 
violence:  
● 45% of women expe rienced bruises and scratches  
"● 12% - Wounds, sprains, burns   "
● 12% - Concussion or other brain injury  
"● 6% - Fractures, broken bones, broken teeth  "
● 2% - Internal injuries   
● 1% - Infection or a sexually transmitted disease  
● 1% - Pregnancy  
● 1% - Miscarriage   ● 1% - Infertility or inability to carry out a pregnancy  
● 39% - No injuries  
Psychological consequences of physical and/or sexual violence (most serious 
incident):  
● 46% - Anxiety   
● 34% - Feeling vulnerable  
● 32% - Difficulties in relationships  
● 28% - Depression   
● 27% - Loss of self confidence   
● 25% - Difficulty in sleeping   
● 23% - Panic attacks   
● 11% - Concentration difficulties   
● 15% - None of the above  
The psychological impact of violence perpetrated by a pr evious partner was 
generally more pronounced than that of violence perpetrated by a current partner 
or non -partner.  
Emotional responses to physical and/or sexual violence (most serious incident) by 
all perpetrators:  
● 61% - Anger  
● 60% - Fear  
● 43% - Shock  
● 41% - Annoyance  
● 28% - Shame  
● 27% - Aggressiveness  
● 22% - Embarrassment  
● 10% - Guilt  
● 1% - None of the above

harassment.  
 
CAPACITIES TO ADDRESS GBV       
 
GBV prevention and pr eparedness:  As a result of the ongoing conflict in the east 
of Ukraine GBV services had gradually expanded as government and local 
communities started to provide specialized  services in addition to those supported 
"by humanitarian partners. However, it is arguable whether they provided sufficient "
preparation to address GBV in the current crisis. Services were largely located in 
"the eastern and  western Oblasts. Referral pathway s, access to specialized  services "
and quality of responses were insufficient and continued to require 
complementary humanitarian GBV responses. Health -care service delivery points 
and mobile clinics offered improved opportunities to the most vulnerable gro ups 
"of GBV survivors; however, access was still limited .  (OCHA, 2022 ). "
As stated Ukrainian and regional women’s organizations  are active in  addressing 
"GBV, but face many challenges as they attempt to provide support to large "
"numbers of IDPs, host -communities and those directly affected by violence and "
"insecurity. They are in desperate need of support. (CARE, 2022 ; UN Women, 2022 ). "
GBV response: Pre the Russian invasion in February 2022 consultations with 
people affected by the conflict in the East highlighted several gaps in the GBV 
"response: the insufficient response by the  police, slowness of ambulance services "
"to reach the villages, the absence of social workers and the discontinuation of day "
care services at the nearest hospital. The wo men consulted also explicitly 
underlined the lack of information on useful contacts for the protection of children 
"and cases of domestic violence . (OCHA, 2022 ).   "
"At the current time, GBV specialized  services continue to operate in a number of "
"municipalities (including many of largest cities of Dnipro, Vinnytsia, Lviv, Odessa, Uzhhorod), though essential serv ices are currently affected by significant gaps and "
limitations:  
● The State was the primary service provider before the war; among the 
"services that are still operational, many have shifted their focus away "
from GBV as they work to meet other urgent needs o f IDPs including 
"temporary accommodation, social protection, caring for the wounded, "
etc. 
● Many service providers are affected by lack of human and financial 
resources – some staff have fled to save their own lives and are now IDPs 
themselves.  
"● There are mor e people in need of services, with IDPs contributing to high "
population concentrations in new/different areas where humanitarian 
operations and GBV services were not previously established or where 
the existing services are not able to adequately respond t o the demand.  
● Many referral pathways are broken (varying region by region due to 
"military activities, increase in IDPs, border crossings and other factors ). "
"● IDPs have limited access to life -saving information, including on the "
"availability of specialized G BV services in hosting communities (GBV AoR, "
"April 1, 2022).  "
GBV actors on the ground report that although specialized  services - including GBV 
"hotlines - remain partially functional, access is extremely difficult for both staff and "
survivors due to ongoing conflict and movement restrictions. La Strada national 
hotline switched to online operation  and faced some initial d isruption to full 24/7 
operation  but has returned  to 24/7 phone operation as of 11 March. An online 
modality remained available. 1547 Hotline continues to provide 24/7 services . 
"(Protection Cluster Ukraine, March 6 -9, 2022 ). However, reaching those in settings "
where active hostilities are taking place remains a challenge.  
“We have had several calls to our emergency hotline from women and girls seeking 
"assistance, but in most cases,  it’s been impossible to help them physically. We "
haven’t been able to reach them because of the fighting”  said Kateryna

"Cherepakha, the president of La Strada Ukraine , a charity that supports survivors "
"of trafficking, domestic violence and sexual assault . (McKernan, April 4, 2022 ). "
"By 12 April , 10 Partner organizations reported on their activities/people reached "
"in 25 Oblasts of Ukraine.  (GBV Sub -cluster Ukraine, April 14, 2022).  "
Clinical care for GBV survivors in Ukraine: Medical and psychological care units 
"are usually located at multidisciplinary hospitals, have medical equipment, "
"diagnostic kits (or rapid test systems), medicines, etc. for protection of "
"reproductive health, HIV  prevention, treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, "
prevention of unwanted pregnancies and provision of emergency care to survivors 
"of rape. There are 17 such units in Ukraine. Six of them are in the Donetsk Oblast, "
"5 in the Luhansk Oblast; others are  located in Vinnytsia, Mykolayiv, Kharkiv, Kryvyi "
"Rih, Odesa and Kherson. Each unit provides 24 -hour free assistance on the basis of "
"anonymity. In addition, most of them have a separate entrance . (GBV AoR "
"Helpdesk, March  1, 2022).  "
UNFPA report that only 29 out of 65 local health care facilities that cater to 
"survivors of GBV, providing shelter or crisis solutions for women and girls a re "
operational and one -third of the cities in which it operates are now occupied by 
"Russian forces . (Lei Ravelo, March 11, 2022 ).   "
Coordination and systems:  Pre the Russian invasion in February 2022 interagency 
coordination and cooperatio n in addressing individual cases was weak and largely 
"unstructured . (Mann and Gugaiets, 2020) . However, according to the GBV "
"partners, local authorities and the national polic e, the number of registered GBV "
incidents consistently increases in Donetsk and Luhansk GCA due to the 
strengthening of response mechanisms and coordination at the local level. 
"Decentralization  processes, however, created some new challenges in "
"strengtheni ng the response system, particularly due to lack of capacities and "
"human resources in duty bearers, turnover of the social services ’ staff and weak "
coordination mechanisms. Essential services for survivors of GBV were not equally accessible everywhere and remained an acute problem in remote and rural areas 
"close to the “contact line” . (OCHA, 2022 ).  "
"UNICEF together with UNHCR establish ed 26 “Blue Dots” across Moldova, "
"Romania, Belarus, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, and Czech Rep ublic. These hubs are "
designed to have the capacity to support 3000 to 5000 people per location. These 
"are hubs to support refugee children, women and families with integrated services. "
"These include child friendly spaces, family reunification, information  and advice "
"desks, mother and baby/toddler spaces, psychosocial, hygiene, health and "
"nutrition, legal counselling, first aid, referral services for cases of violence, and "
"basic needs. (GBV AoR Helpdesk, March  1, 2022).  "
The GBV Sub -Cluster is focused on  ensur ing referrals and emergency care for 
survivors of GBV (including emergency contraception and PEP to prevent 
transmission of HIV) are prioritized  throughout the response . 
"In terms of mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS), multiple shelters "
"have areas set aside for psychological counseling, but as with the medical staff, "
"staffing these is a challenge, and counselors are working as volunteers, coming "
"when they can, to support as much as they can. Counselling sessions generally "
"occur with a translator, as  Ukrainian -speaking psychologists are not readily "
available. A recent assessment found only limited case management services for 
"women, children, or persons with special needs . (IRC, 2022 ). "
"GBV risk management: UNFPA has delivered over 12,000 dignity kits to at risk "
"women and girls in Ukraine , Moldova and Belarus (UNFPA, April 19, 2022)  and has "
developed GBV awareness -raising materials that include information about GBV 
risk reduction and specialized services in Ukraine and neighboring countries. The 
materials are being distributed jointly with WHO at border crossing points and in 
"cities with highest numbers of IDPs . (Protection Cluster Ukraine,  March 6 -9, 2022 ).  "

"Secondary Data Review, 27 April 2022  "
 
INFORMATION GAPS AND NEEDS  
 
● The service mapping is difficult to complete due to the fluid and shifting 
situation and the broad scope of topics to cover.  
● Sex disaggregated  data for the current crisis is lacking. The disaggregated 
information that is available on the conflict is from the protracted conflict 
experienced in East Ukraine since 201 4. Few resources document the 
experiences and priorities of women and girls themselves.  
"● There is little sex disaggregated  data intersecting with age, ethnicity, "
"disability, drug use, HIV status available although some is available from "
pre the Russian invasion  in February 2022.   
● Sex disaggregated  data on IDPs and intersections with other 
vulnerabilities as well as information on the response to GBV is needed.  
 
LESSONS LEARNED  
 
• Some lessons from the earlier conflict in East Ukraine  (such as 
documentation challenges and barriers to accessing services)  will be 
relevant for humanitarian response to factor for  and others will be less 
"applicable , given the scale and magnitude of the present conflict and "
affected persons  it will be necess ary to ensure current needs are assessed 
and responded to as access permits . 
• Women and girls’  engagement in decision making processes within 
"Ukraine at all levels local, regional, national will be key to supporting "
"safety, improving GBV response, preventio n and risk mitigation measures.  "
• Local and national WROs that remain within Ukraine urgently need 
support from the international community in order to continue to support 
their communities.  This support includes material support and funding 
support.  It is  likely that there will be on -going technical support needs 
"and collective care needs for GBV responders and therefore th ese should be identified in consultation with those responding, be well-resourced "
and coordinated  efforts.  
• Women and girls who face intersecting forms of marginalization and 
oppression (eg. older Roma women) are least likely to be able to access 
"timely, quality GBV response services when they experience violence.  It "
"is therefore essential that there are diverse service points, with tr ained "
female staff and widespread messaging about the services available.  
• SEA risks exist within all humanitarian crises and emerging findings 
indicate that it is necessary to prevent GBV risk mitigation and ensure 
PSEA measures are in place with robust PS EA networks and focal points.  
"• Women and Girls Safe Spaces, the provision of GBV clinical care in health "
facilities and other safe spaces and GBV hotlines are essential life -saving 
services which should be prioritized  within the response.  
 
LIMITATIONS  
 
● Given the urgency of the response and the gap in a prior SDR it was 
necessary to produce this SDR within a condensed timeframe in order to 
"inform the responses therefore , it is feasible that  not all relevant "
information  and sources are  included . 
● This crisi s is unfolding and evolving in real time with the possibility of new 
frontiers/contact lines in the conflict opening up.  The data contained 
within is therefore a catalogue of prior data and currently relevant data 
but may require updating regularly to acc ount for the fast -moving 
changes.  
"● There is not a lot of quantitative evidence  available , the number of GBV "
incidents presented does not necessarily  imply prevalence and cannot be 
interpreted as such . 
● Unreliability of certain sources  is a possibility .  
● Lack of assessments and inclusive methodologie s that capture the views 
"of women and girls , particularly women and girls who experience "
intersecting forms of marginalization .

"UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, provides aid to Ukrainianpeople facing different challenges caused by Russian aggression, likeconﬂict-related sexual violence (CRSV). Among these challenges is thedistressing issue of sexual violence linked to the ongoing conﬂict.Through collaborative efforts with the Government of Ukraine, UNFPAhas set up Survivor Relief Centers and the Aurora online platform toprovide support to survivors. We are joined by Pavlo ZAMOSTIAN,UNFPA Assistant Representative in Ukraine, and Nina LOMPART,UNFPA Project Coordinator, to discuss the signiﬁcance of theseservices.– What were the reasons behind establishing services for survivors of CRSV?Pavlo ZAMOSTIAN: – Together with the Government of Ukraine, we thought aboutexpanding the existing services for survivors of domestic and gender-basedviolence to accommodate the emerging challenges arising from the war. Onesigniﬁcant challenge was widespread sexual violence perpetrated by Russiancombatants, which led to new needs among survivors, especially for long-termpsychotherapy. Rather than just providing temporary psychological assistance overa few therapy sessions, survivors of sexual violence require sustainedpsychotherapy due to the profound nature of the trauma they experienced.We realized that survivors of CRSV might not feel ready to talk in person, face to20/06/2024, 01:03Page 2 of 11"
"face, right away. They might also move, including abroad. At the same time, therewas a big demand for psychotherapists in Ukraine, while their availability remainedscarce. So, we decided that providing professional help online would be the bestway to make it easier for survivors to get support from anywhere while keeping itconﬁdential and supportive.On May 31, 2022, we launched the Aurora online platform with the assistance of theOfﬁce of the Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration ofUkraine and the Government Commissioner for Gender Policy, and with thesupport of the UK Government. We started with our existing resources to developit as a temporary solution. However, our long-standing business partner, theleading Ukrainian company “SoftServe,” based in Lviv and one of the world’s largestIT companies, helped us create its technical component. Now, the platform is fullyup and running.– What are the features and advantages of the Platform?"
"Pavlo ZAMOSTIAN: –  Anyone who feels they need help from a psychotherapist,whether because of being held captive, living in occupied areas, experiencingsexual violence, or going through other traumatic events, can seek help from theplatform. It ensures complete conﬁdentiality, enabling individuals to openly sharetheir experiences with specialists without worrying about any negativeconsequences.DONATEABOUT USWHAT WE DOOPPORTUNITIES"
"EN20/06/2024, 01:03Page 3 of 11"
"Another beneﬁt of the Platform is its extraterritoriality, being accessible fromanywhere via Internet, even from occupied territories or abroad.After completing a quick assessment to identify their required assistance,individuals are matched with a psychotherapist for one-on-one sessionsthroughout their rehabilitation without changing therapists. This ongoing supportis important because it prevents survivors from having to repeatedly share theirexperiences with different specialists, thereby avoiding additional trauma.– How popular has this service been?Pavlo ZAMOSTIAN: – At the moment, we are handling around 300 requests,providing regular support to 192 clients, mostly women—approximately 180individuals. About 25% of these cases involve various forms of sexual violence.Sexual violence extends beyond rape; strip searches at checkpoints also qualify assexual violence. However, not everyone who undergoes such experience realisethey are victims or recognise the need for assistance. The sooner they come tounderstand this, the greater their chances for recovery.Indeed, individuals may initially be focused on feeling happy for making it through.After enduring such difﬁcult situations, they might focus more on immediateneeds and overlook the psychological trauma. However, as time passes, theuntreated trauma can lead to negative consequences. Hence, it is part of Auroraspecialists’ job to guide individuals in recognising the importance ofpsychotherapy.– Apart from the Aurora online platform, Survivor Relief Centers are beingestablished in Ukraine. How fast were they put together?Pavlo ZAMOSTIAN: – The events in Bucha shook the world with the extent of thecrimes committed. Following that, many non-governmental and internationalorganisations began offering aid to survivors, including conﬂict-related sexualviolence. However, a coordinating hub was needed. It should be noted that thereisn’t much positive international experience in this area, as discussions aboutconﬂict-related sexual crimes typically occur after the conﬂict has ended.Consequently, the response often arrives late, when much has already been lost.Ukraine’s success can be attributed to the Government’s prompt response to theissue as soon as it arose. They initiated setting up survivor relief centers wheresurvivors or victims could seek help. These centers not only offer services but alsocarefully identify survivors of CRSV and provide assistance or refer them to Auroraor other service providers. These centers act as support hubs. The Governmenttook the initiative on this project, and UNFPA is proud to have longstandingpartnerships with the Ofﬁce of Deputy Prime Minister Olha Stefanishyna. TheyCONTACTS"

"approached us as experts capable of quickly ﬂeshing out their ideas. It is great thatthis Ofﬁce has taken on coordinating and leading the project.The Survivor Relief Centres were started on the initiative of the Ofﬁce of the DeputyPrime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration of Ukraine, withassistance from the Government Commissioner for Gender Policy and supportfrom the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). This project is a pilot initiative,funded entirely by humanitarian resources entrusted to us by donors.Nina LOMPART: – This network was established in June 2022. The ﬁrst Center wasopened in Zaporizhzhia to respond to the occupation of Mariupol and neighboringtowns, resulting in the displacement of Ukrainian citizens.The Center was set up in just three weeks. Our main approach to operating theCenters is efﬁciency. We strive to respond quickly to events happening in the citieswhere the Centers are located, ensuring prompt delivery of aid to affected areasduring shelling. For instance, in Kherson, we distributed essential aid kits toresidents within two days. We are actively involved in providing assistance directlyat the scenes of shelled areas.We maintain constant communication and close collaboration with relevantauthorities, actively listening to local residents to identify their needs. Based on theidentiﬁed needs, we proceed with our initiatives. We established Centers in thecities that experienced the highest number of internally displaced persons (IDPs)relocating from elsewhere during the summer and fall seasons. Thus, Centers wereopened in Dnipro, Lviv, and Kyiv, followed by Poltava, Kropyvnytskyi, and Odesa. Inthe western area, we gave priority to Mukacheve and Chernivtsi, which serve asmajor transit points for people relocating abroad.Currently, we have 9 Centers operating in a stationary setup, equipped withpremises and staff. Additionally, in Kharkiv and Kherson, we operate mobileCenters. This summer we are establishing a Survivor Relief Center in Kharkiv.Today, our coverage spans nearly every region of Ukraine. We and not discussingevery local center right now as we do not feel it is necessary. However, if the needarises, we will expand our reach across the map of Ukraine.Pavlo ZAMOSTIAN: – The Centers model was effective: people started coming, andwe ensured they had accommodation. In Zaporizhzhia, the Center operated at ahumanitarian hub, serving as a refuge for all internally displaced persons arriving inthe city via evacuation buses or by crossing the contact line independently. Theaim was for individuals to access humanitarian aid and essential services there,while the Survivor Relief Center offered further help. Unfortunately, due to theworsening security situation, we had to move as Zaporizhzhia came under heavier20/06/2024, 01:03Page 5 of 11"
"shelling.– What services are offered by the Survivor Relief Centres?Pavlo ZAMOSTIAN: – The Centers were created to respond to the violencestemming from the war. Their primary goal is to encourage survivors toacknowledge their need for aid and to offer them that support. Investigations intocrimes, punishment for perpetrators, and compensation follow later. Those are alllong-term goals, but right now, the priority should be helping individuals inovercoming the trauma they’re experiencing.The main goal is to identify the problems individuals encounter as a result of thewar. These challenges often involve mental health issues. But sometimes, peoplefeel disoriented and do not know what to do next. This is where specialists at theCenters can help by providing guidance on the next steps and by asking about theperson’s experiences in a considerate manner.Our experience suggests that people often return to the Centers seekingassistance. They may not always feel comfortable opening up during their initialvisit, and it might require a second, third, or even fourth consultation for them tofeel ready to do so. Sometimes, individuals share their experiences from a third-person perspective rather than their own. However, our therapists are skilled atguiding individuals to share their own stories, as well as those of their children orparents. Some people come with a speciﬁc goal in mind, such as wanting toengage with law enforcement. In such cases, the therapist accompanies themduring these conversations, ensuring they are conducted in a less traumaticmanner.We stress the critical importance of putting the needs of survivors ﬁrst. We stronglybelieve that with the right support, individuals can move from being mere victimsto empowered survivors, leading normal lives. It is all about adapting and carryingon with life. – Are there regional speciﬁcs in the work of the Centers?20/06/2024, 01:03Page 6 of 11"
Nina
"LOMPART: – Certainly, we notice certain differences in how the Survivor ReliefCenter operates across different regions of Ukraine—whether in the central,western, or regions bordering the east or south. These differences are driven by theunique needs expressed by those seeking aid. In cities such as Zaporizhzhia andDnipro, IDPs often require immediate psychological support. Conversely, in areas20/06/2024, 01:03Page 7 of 11"
"like Lviv or Mukacheve, requests typically revolve around temporary housing oraccommodation. As a result, these differences shape the types of services soughtby potential clients and guide where our staff members focus their attention.At ﬁrst, when someone is forced to leave their home, their primary concern issafety. It is only later that they start thinking about their social well-being.Therefore, we pay close attention to the journey of internally displaced Ukrainiansas they move, for instance, from the eastern to the western regions of the country.They may require crisis counseling from a psychologist somewhere nearZaporizhzhia or Dnipro. As they get closer to Lviv in the west, they are likely to shifttheir focus towards more strategic concerns about securing their future life.– How often do survivors of wartime sexual violence seek assistance from theCenters?Nina LOMPART: – This question doesn’t have a straightforward answer becausethe issue emerged in Ukraine due to the war. We cannot simply replicate theexperiences of other countries in addressing CRSV. Specialists in Ukraine areessentially starting from square one, creating their own methods and practicesfrom scratch.Typically, people do not discuss war-related sexual violence during their ﬁrstconsultations. It could be brought up weeks, years, or even decades later. As aresult, current statistics on the frequency or location of reports do not demonstrateany clear patterns. It may take many years, or even decades, to collect sufﬁcientdata. Although we have reports available, discussing speciﬁc numbers is notpractical at the moment.– Who are the main users of the Centers’ services?Nina LOMPART: – Most of our clients are internally displaced persons. However,there have been changes in this distribution. While IDPs accounted for 95-98% ofour clients a year ago, their proportion has now dropped. Currently, about 85% ofrequests come from IDPs, while the remaining 15% come from residents of thecommunities where our services are offered.This is because the Survivor Relief Centers are not exclusively designed for theneeds of IDPs. These centers are available to anyone who requires assistance dueto the effects of the war.The majority of requests come from women, constituting approximately 75% of thetotal. However, men also seek assistance, making up 25% of our clients.In terms of age distribution, the largest group comprises individuals aged 18-59,though there is also representation from those over 60. We provide assistance to20/06/2024, 01:03Page 8 of 11"
"more than 10% of women aged 60 and above, and around 5% of men in this agebracket.The Survivor Relief Centers have psychologists who specialize in aiding childrenand can assist young clients with parental consent. Approximately 5-7% of ourclients are individuals under 18 years old.Pavlo ZAMOSTIAN: – As of the end of May 2023, over 16,000 individuals hadaccessed the services offered by the Survivor Relief Centers, leading to theidentiﬁcation of over 100 cases of CRSV. – Do the Centers cooperate with law enforcement agencies?Nina LOMPART: – The Survivor Relief Centers operate based on clear principles,which prioritize safety, conﬁdentiality, free access, and non-conditionality.Individuals seeking assistance are not required to provide any proof of beingsurvivors through documents, actions, photographs, or messages to receive helpfrom our staff. Consequently, our non-conditionality principle guides ourinteractions with police and law enforcement agencies; we do not document thesecrimes or share such information.However, we collaborate with law enforcement agencies when survivors express awillingness to do so. If someone seeking assistance from the Survivor Relief Centerwishes to ﬁle a complaint or pursue legal action, we assist them in doing so.– Is the Ukrainian experience in these matters considered innovative?Pavlo ZAMOSTIAN: – Ukraine has demonstrated political readiness to respond andprovide services to survivors of traumatic events, including CRSV, already duringthe war, which was a unique initiative at the time. The effectiveness of thisapproach will be evaluated by post-war analysis. We hope that the efforts of Auroraand Survivor Relief Centers, as well as the Ukrainian Government’s leadership, willprove successful.Ukraine is leading the way in conducting legal proceedings for unlawful actions byRussian combatants even during the war, which differs from the typical practiceobserved in other countries, where such proceedings often take place decadeslater. Even if the perpetrator is no longer alive or present in the courtroom, thisrepresents signiﬁcant legal progress. This determination, coupled with politicalleadership and the commitment to address CRSV during wartime, showcasesinnovation.The network is up and running, but we are always looking to make it better. Ourpractices help us identify areas for improvement. For example, when new clientscome to us, we request additional therapists from Dnipro with expertise in child20/06/2024, 01:03Page 9 of 11"
"counseling to aid in investigations. Our goal is to address these issues promptly.A Ukrainian delegation led by Kateryna Levchenko, the Government Commissionerfor Gender Policy, recently traveled to the Czech Republic. The discussions focusedon the possibility of setting up the ﬁrst international Ukrainian Survivor ReliefCenter in Prague. A similar center may also be opened in Germany.– Will the Survivor Relief Centers and the Aurora online platform remain inoperation after the end of the Russian-Ukrainian war?Pavlo ZAMOSTIAN: – This support is designed to be ongoing. Therefore, we willengage in discussions with donors to ensure that both the Centers and the Auroraplatform become part of Ukraine’s violence response system. Our collaborationwith the Government and the Ministry of Social Policy is effective. We are currentlydeveloping the model regulations for the Centers, which will allow us to graduallyintegrate them into the system.We anticipate more territories to be liberated, where Ukrainian residents willencounter the same challenges of war. There may be a new wave of survivors,particularly of CRSV, prompting the opening of new Centers. Initially, these Centerswill be mobile, and then we will see.New tasks may emerge, such as assisting veteran families in preventing violenceand providing tailored support to the families as they help reintegrate veterans intosociety.Given the widespread trauma inﬂicted by the war on Ukrainian society, extensiverehabilitation efforts will be needed. And that will take time. Volodymyr DOBROTA,National Press Club “Ukrainian Perspective”The material presented herein was prepared as part of the Project “RESILIENTTOGETHER: Improving the system of response to Conﬂict-Related SexualViolence (CRSV)”.

REGIONAL UKRAINE REFUGEE RESPONSE  
GENDER -BASED VIOLENCE SUB -WORKING GROUP  
Terms of Reference  
 
BACKGROUND   
 
The vast majority of  refugees fleeing Ukraine are women and children – some 90 per cent. From its 
"onset, the gendered profile of Ukraine refugee crisis became evident, as most of refugees arriving "
"were women -headed households, single women, adolescent girls, and elderly women . Further "
"exacerbating the risks of gender -based violence (GBV), this crisis became a family separation crisis, as "
men aged 18 -60 are banned from leaving the country under the martial law. The mass movement has 
been happening quickly and in large number (o ften referred to as fastest growing refugee crisis from 
"the times of WWII), resulting in family separations and heightened protection risks, especially for "
"women, girls and other categories of people with heightened protection needs on the move.    "
 
"Gender -based violence is usually under -reported. Meanwhile, gender -based violence risks for women "
"and girls, including conflict -related sexual violence (CRSV), are heightened in the context of war and "
"armed conflict, which would also apply to the current s ituation in Ukraine. For women and girls inside "
"Ukraine and those on the move, the risks of gender -based violence are multiple and include conflict -"
"related sexual violence (CRSV), trafficking, intimate partners violence and other forms of violence. The "
"risks for women and girls on the move are present at border crossing points, transit/collective and "
"reception centres , in the context of private and informal transportation and accommodation "
arrangements in neighbouring countries. LGBTQI+ refugees and persons  with disabilities also face 
heightened risks of gender -based violence during throughout the cycle of displacement.  
Women Against Violence Europe ( hereinafter referred to as: WAVE) Network.  
 
"Refugees , stateless persons, and third -country nationals , in p articular women and girls fleeing Ukraine "
need urgent action  to prevent gender -based violence and respond to its life -threatening 
"consequences, as well as mitigate the GBV risks. Gender -based violence is a key life -threatening "
protection risk for refugee w omen and girls fleeing Ukraine and needs to be prioritized in the 
"emergency response, both in Ukraine and the host countries. The national systems capacity to provide "
"adequate GBV multisectoral response services and support, such as psychosocial support, s afe shelter, "
"and clinical care (including for management of rape), are under intense pressure to absorb the "
demand. Humanitarian organizations focus first and foremost on the safety and well -being of 
"survivors, including by strengthening the access and the  quality of GBV services (including health "
"services, psycho -social support, legal assistance and security services aimed at improvement of all the "
four pillars of the response ). 
 
"In March 2022, UNHCR and partners launched the Regional Refugee Response Plan  (RRP) to promote "
and implement a comprehensive response to support efforts by five countries neighbouring Ukraine 
to protect and assist refugees coming from Ukraine. UNHCR leads and coordinates the 
implementation of the RRP in line with the Refugee Coordi nation Model (RCM) and in close 
"collaboration and consultation with relevant government counterparts, and with the support of inter -"
agency partners and other stakeholders. Within the framework of the RRP and building on existing 
"country -level humanitarian coordination structures, an inter -agency Regional Refugee Coordination "
Forum (RCF) chaired by UNHCR with participation from RRF members and other relevant actors has 
been established in Geneva to ensure efficient situational information management and supp ort to 
country level coordination as required.  
 
""
 
UNHCR has established and is co -leading GBV inter -agency coordination structures in Poland (with 
Fundacja Centrum Praw Kobiet (CPK) – Women’s Rights Center Foundation) and Moldova (with 
"UNFPA), while in the other neighbouring  countries, GBV is a standing agenda item of the national "
"Protection Working Groups chaired by UNHCR in Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. In light of the high "
"number of women and girls affected by the emergency, and the wide range of interse ctional "
"protection risks at stake, an agreement was reached among RCF members on the need to establish a "
"Regional Sub -Working Group focused on Gender -Based Violence, co -chaired by UNHCR and WAVE , "
and working under the auspices and guidance of the Regional Protection Working Group. The Regional 
GBV SWG also has direct linkages with national GBV SWGs in the region.  
 
GOAL  
 
The Regional Gender -Based Violence Sub -Working Group (GBV SWG) is a coordination body with the 
"objective to strengthen GBV prevention, risk mitigation and response in emergency settings. It aims "
"to ensure coherent, coordinated, effective and quality GBV prevention, risk mitigation and response "
"interventions through the mobilization of relevant government agencies, internationa l organizations, "
"UN Agencies, national and international non -governmental organizations (NGOs), civil society "
"networks, national refugee -led organizations, refugee women -led organizations.  "
 
"The main goal is to ensure relevant and robust coordination mechan isms, including information "
"management, timely and effective needs assessments, planning, prioritization, implementation, "
"reporting and evaluation, under the overall umbrella of the Regional Protection Working Group.  "
It provides technical and policy guida nce and support to the GBV SWGs established at country level in 
"Poland and Moldova, and the national Protection Working Groups in Hungary, Slovakia and Romania, "
"and seeks to ensure effective, coherent and predictable interventions to support these countrie s "
Governments’ efforts to respond to the needs arising in the area of GBV. The GBV SWG ensures quality 
"services are in place for multi -sectoral GBV response, GBV prevention is strengthened while "
supporting the integration of GBV risk mitigation interventio ns within other sectors in line with the 
IASC GBV Guidelines.  
 
The  GBV SWG members will adhere to standards set forth in the Inter -agency Minimum Standards 
"for Gender -Based Violence in Emergency programming  and the IASC GBV Guidelines , WHO ethical "
"and safety recommendations , and the interagency case management guidelines .   "
 
The GBV SWG will promote leadership of and direct engagement with refugee women and girls within 
the refugee response and  promote membership and co -leadership of refugee -led and women -led 
organisations (RLOs  and WLOs). It will ensure accountability to affected populations through 
consultative and participative approaches.  
 
MAIN PRINCIPLES  
 
The guiding principles for GBV coordination and programming ensure we meet our obligations as 
humanitarians to “Do No Har m”1. The GBV guiding principles for GBV coordination and 
"programming are: safety, respect, confidentiality and non -discrimination. Application of these "
principles at all times is mandatory. Programming and coordination adhere  to the human rights -
based and  community -based approaches2.  Everyone directly or indirectly engaged with survivors 
 
1 A ‘do no harm’ approach involves taking all measures necessary to avoid exposing people to further harm as a result of the ac tions of 
humanitarian actors.  
2 Rights -based approach: A rights -based approach seeks to analyse and address the root causes of disc rimination and inequality to ensure 
"that everyone has the right to live with freedom and dignity, safe from violence, exploitation and abuse, in accordance with principles of "
human rights law. Community -based approach: A community -based approach ensures th at affected populations are engaged actively as 
partners in developing strategies related to their protection and the provision of humanitarian assistance. This approach inv olves direct 
"involvement of women, girls and other at -risk groups at all stages in the humanitarian response, to identify protection risks and solutions, "

"must ensure a survivor -centred approach , and the following Guiding Principles3. "
 
Guiding principles for GBV coordination and programming:  
 
"▪ Confidentiality: No identifying information will be revealed in data resources, nor during "
"discussions in coordination and other meetings, when reference is made to specific GBV "
"cases. In GBV SWG meetings, GBV trends are discussed, however individual and/o r specific "
cases should not be discussed in order to ensure confidentiality. Measures will be promoted 
and disseminated to ensure GBV actors abide to the principle of confidentiality. Survivors 
have the right to decide with whom they share information and informed consent must be 
obtained for service provision;  
"▪ Safety: all actors will prioritize the safety of the survivor, beneficiary, family, witnesses and "
"service providers at all times. At coordination level, we will ensure coordination prioritizes "
"the sa fety and security of GBV service providers, survivors and others accessing assistance;  "
"▪ Respect: actions and responses of all actors will be guided by respect for the choices, "
"wishes, rights and the dignity of the survivor;  "
"▪ Non -discrimination: non-discrimination on the basis of nationality, race, religion, political "
"views, sexual orientation, social or other status. The GBV SWG will promote tailored "
programming for groups at heightened risk of GBV while also ensuring GBV serv ices are 
"accessible for all across status, background, age and disability.  "
 
Survivor -centred  approach: A survivor -centred  approach means that all those who are engaged in 
"GBV programming prioritize the rights, needs, and wishes of the survivor. Essentially , a survivor "
centred  approach applies the human rights -based approach to designing and developing 
programming that ensures that survivors’ rights and needs are first and foremost.  
 
The survivor centred  approach aims to create a supportive environment in which the survivor’s rights 
are respected and in which she/he is treated with dignity and respect. The approach helps to promote 
"the survivor’s recovery and ability to identify and express needs and wish es, as well as to reinforce "
her/his capacity to make decisions about possible interventions. Providers must have the resources 
and tools they need to ensure that such an  approach is implemented.

Thenumerical scores and status listed above do not reﬂect conditions in the previouslyoccupied Ukrainian territories of Crimea and Eastern Donbas, which are examined inseparate reports. Freedom in the World reports assess the level of political rights andcivil liberties in a given geographical area, regardless of whether they are aﬀected bythe state, nonstate actors, or foreign powers. Disputed or occupied territories aresometimes assessed separately if they meet certain criteria, including boundaries thatare suﬃciently stable to allow year-on-year comparisons. For more information, see thereport methodology and FAQ.OverviewThe Russian armed forces launched an all-out invasion of Ukraine in February 2022,inﬂicting massive civilian and military casualties and destroying civilian infrastructure.Millions of Ukrainians have been displaced from their homes, and Russian troops haveengaged in extrajudicial executions, torture, and sexual violence against local residents.In areas subjected to longer periods of occupation, Russian authorities have usedintimidation, arbitrary detention, and torture to assert control over political expression,the education system, and many other aspects of civilian life. Ukraine has receivedsubstantial military, diplomatic, humanitarian, and ﬁnancial support from the UnitedStates, European Union (EU) member states, and other democracies since the full-scaleinvasion. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared martial law immediately after theinvasion and was widely credited with overseeing a successful defense eﬀort, thoughhis government has also implemented some war-related legal changes that drewinternational and domestic criticism for their impact on civil liberties. In previous years,the current and other Ukrainian administrations had enacted a number of positivereforms as part of a drive to strengthen democratic institutions, combat corruption,and reduce the inﬂuence of politically powerful business magnates.TOP20/06/2024, 00:21Page 2 of 24"
"Key Developments in 2022On February 24, the Russian military launched an all-out invasion of Ukraine fromboth Russian and Belarusian territory, striking major cities across the country andpressing toward the capital. President Zelenskyy immediately declared martial law,which was approved by the parliament and entered into force on the same day.After the Ukrainian army forced Russian troops to retreat from the Kyiv,Chernihiv, and Sumy Regions in early April, most ﬁghting was concentrated ineastern and southern areas of Ukraine. However, Moscow carried outindiscriminate missile and artillery strikes on Ukrainian cities throughout the year.Civilian and military targets were struck across the country, leaving millions ofcivilians without electricity, heating, water, or adequate housing. The war alsocaused massive civilian and military casualties, and millions of Ukrainians wereinternally displaced or compelled to seek refuge abroad. Russian troops engagedin extrajudicial executions, torture, sexual violence, and other crimes againstcivilians. More than 15 percent of Ukrainian territory, including Crimea andEastern Donbas, was under Russian occupation at year’s end.In June, the European Council granted Ukraine EU candidate status. The decisionwas viewed as an important demonstration of support for Ukrainians andopposition to the Russian invasion.Also during the year, Ukrainian authorities appointed a new chief anticorruptionprosecutor, who quickly reopened stalled cases and launched new investigations,and ratiﬁed the Istanbul Convention, the Council of Europe’s treaty on preventingand combating violence against women and domestic violence.In July, the parliament adopted a new labor code that eﬀectively strippedemployees of small and medium-sized companies of many legal protections.Zelenskyy ratiﬁed the change in August after adding a last-minute qualiﬁcationthat it would only be eﬀective while Ukraine was under martial law. In December,Zelenskyy signed a controversial bill that expanded the government’s power toregulate media groups and journalists.Political Rights20/06/2024, 00:21Page 3 of 24"
"A. Electoral ProcessA1 0-4 ptsWas the current head of government or other chief national authority electedthrough free and fair elections?4 The president is directly elected for up to two ﬁve-year terms. In the 2019 election, heldin two rounds in March and April, Zelenskyy defeated incumbent president PetroPoroshenko with 73.2 percent of the second-round vote, winning a majority of votes inall but one region. International observers deemed the election competitive andcredible, although polling could not take place in Crimea and Eastern Donbas.A2 0-4 ptsWere the current national legislative representatives elected through free andfair elections?3 The 450 members of the unicameral Supreme Council (Verkhovna Rada) are elected toﬁve-year terms through a mixed system in which half of the members are chosen byclosed-list proportional representation and the other half in single-member districts.In early elections held in July 2019, President Zelenskyy’s Servant of the People partywon 254 seats, giving it an outright majority—the ﬁrst time any party had crossed thatthreshold since independence. The Poroshenko bloc, which had rebranded asEuropean Solidarity, took 25 seats. The Opposition Platform–For Life (OPZZh) groupingtook 43 seats, Fatherland 26, and the Voice Party 20.The elections were deemed generally competitive and credible, despite someproblems. Voting was impossible in Crimea and Eastern Donbas. Consequently, theelections ﬁlled only 424 of the 450 seats. In addition, approximately one millionUkrainian citizens were unable to vote for lack of a registered address.

"practice of exploiting all possible legislative loopholes” that contributed to inequalitiesamong competitors.Ukraine held local elections in October 2020. A plurality of elected local councillorsnationwide were independent candidates. Servant of the People was largelyunsuccessful when contesting the mayoralties of larger cities, though it maintainedrepresentation on most city councils. Despite the generally professional administrationof the elections by the Central Election Commission (TVK) during the COVID-19pandemic, OSCE observers again expressed concern about widespread vote-buyingallegations and abuse of state resources, among other issues.A3 0-4 ptsAre the electoral laws and framework fair, and are they implementedimpartially by the relevant election management bodies?2 The mixed electoral system for the parliament that governed past polls, including thosein 2019, has been criticized as prone to manipulation and vote-buying. PresidentZelenskyy attempted to introduce an entirely party-list-based system prior to the 2019parliamentary elections but could not garner enough support from lawmakers. ThatDecember, the new parliament adopted an electoral code that partially implemented aproportional-representation voting system, with open party lists for both parliamentaryand local elections. Zelenskyy enacted it at the end of that year.The 2020 local elections were held under the new code, though it was modiﬁed anumber of times that year; among other changes, internally displaced persons (IDPs)who lacked documentation for their current place of residence were allowed to vote inlocal elections, helping to resolve one criticism of the 2019 national polls. The TVKdecided not to conduct local elections in 18 communities in the Donetsk and LuhanskRegions of eastern Ukraine, located close to the contact line with noncontrolledterritories. The decision aﬀected 475,000 voters, who continued to be governed bymilitary-civil administrations appointed directly by the president. In December 2021, theTVK began discussions with the Donetsk and Luhansk military-civil administrations onthe possibility of holding elections there in March 2022, but the Russian military’s all-"

The next parliamentary elections were set totake place by October 2023, and the next presidential election was due in 2024.B. Political Pluralism andParticipationB1 0-4 ptsDo the people have the right to organize in diﬀerent political parties or othercompetitive political groupings of their choice, and is the system free ofundue obstacles to the rise and fall of these competing parties or groupings?2 Prior to the 2022 invasion, with the exception of a ban on the Communist Party, therewere no formal barriers to the creation and operation of political parties in Ukraine.However, in May 2022, Zelenskyy signed a law banning political parties that justify,recognize as legitimate, or deny Russian aggression against Ukraine. More than a dozenparties were subsequently identiﬁed as “pro-Russian” and banned, including the largestopposition party, the OPZZh. Five parties appealed the decision in courts, and someanalysts and civil society groups expressed concern about a lack of safeguards toprevent these fast-track party bans from being imposed arbitrarily.Some members of the banned parties found ways to stay in oﬃce. A number of OPZZhmembers left the party and formed two new parliamentary groups, the Platform forLife and Peace (PZZhM) and the Restoration of Ukraine (VU). These lawmakersfrequently voted in support of Zelenskyy’s initiatives during 2022 to demonstrate theirreadiness to cooperate with the ruling party. Ukraine’s opposition factions have alsounited into an informal “defense coalition” to minimize inﬁghting and accelerate thepassage of laws that are critical to national security. In March, the parliament strippedone national parliament member, Illia Kyva, of his mandate on suspicion of treason."

"In occupied parts of Ukraine, the Russian military has used intimidation, arbitrarydetention, and torture to assert control over political expression and activities, and toforce local civilians to submit to Russian rule. The Russian security services compiledlists of potential dissenters and conducted “ﬁltration” at checkpoints throughoutRussian-controlled areas. Some who escaped occupied areas reported being forced todenounce Ukraine and pledge allegiance to Russia on camera. It is estimated that morethan 600 people who opposed the occupation were disappeared during the eight-month-long Russian military presence in western Kherson Region alone.A law that took eﬀect in 2016 provides parliamentary parties with state funding, but iteﬀectively favors established groups. Parties must win at least 5 percent of the vote toreceive funding. New party registration fees are extremely high relative to averageincome and cost of living. Parties can only register with the Ministry of Justice if theycan demonstrate a signiﬁcant support base (10,000 signatures) in two-thirds ofUkraine’s oblasts (regions). Massive war-induced population displacement and humanlosses in 2022 presented additional challenges to future party formation.Party ﬁnancing in Ukraine remains opaque, despite robust laws to regulate it. InNovember 2021, a law banning politically connected business magnates, known asoligarchs, from funding political parties went into eﬀect.Score Change: The score declined from 3 to 2 because Russian forces violentlysuppressed Ukrainian political activity in occupied areas, and the Ukrainian governmentimplemented a new law allowing swift bans on political parties that were identiﬁed as“pro-Russian.”B2 0-4 ptsIs there a realistic opportunity for the opposition to increase its support orgain power through elections?4 Ukrainian politics feature dynamic competition among parties.

However, the scale and scope of the 2022 invasion and atrocities committed byRussian troops against Ukrainian civilians have broken many of these ties, and theRussian government now largely relies on armed force to control political aﬀairs inareas under its control.Ukrainian oligarchs exert signiﬁcant inﬂuence over politics directly and indirectly,including through ﬁnancial support for political parties and lobbying for theappointment of loyalists to key institutional positions. However, individuals deﬁned asoligarchs under legislation signed into law in November 2021 were prohibited fromfunding political parties.Although electoral laws forbid the use of public resources in election campaigns,incumbent oﬃcials were able to use administrative resources without penalty duringthe 2020 local election campaign.B4 0-4 ptsDo various segments of the population (including ethnic, racial, religious,gender, LGBT+, and other relevant groups) have full political rights andelectoral opportunities?3 There are no formal restrictions on the participation of women and members of ethnic,racial, or other minority groups in political life.

Severe violence and repression that accompanied the 2022Russian invasion precluded meaningful political participation for many individuals.A record 87 women were elected to the parliament in 2019, though this amounted toonly 20 percent of all seats.

"Are safeguards against oﬃcial corruption strong and eﬀective?1 Corruption remains a serious problem, and the political will to ﬁght it has beeninconsistent. Anticorruption agencies have repeatedly been ensnared in politicallyfraught conﬂicts with other state entities and elected oﬃcials. In a ruling published in2020, the Constitutional Court restricted many of the powers held by the NationalAgency on Corruption Prevention, impairing its ability to function.In July 2022, in response to recommendations that accompanied the EU decision togrant Ukraine candidate status, Ukrainian leaders ﬁnally appointed experiencedinvestigator Oleksandr Klymenko as the head of the Specialized Anti-CorruptionProsecutor’s Oﬃce, after a long selection process that followed his predecessor’sresignation nearly two years earlier. Klymenko reopened a number of stalled cases andopened a new case against lawmaker Andriy Derkach for allegedly receiving paymentsfrom Russian intelligence agencies in exchange for planning subversive activities againstUkraine.In May 2022, the parliament registered a draft law under which individuals facingcriminal corruption charges for the ﬁrst time could avoid penalties if they compensatedin full for any ﬁnancial damage they had caused. The authors of the draft law, whichwould apply during the period of martial law, claimed to be motivated by a desire toconserve law enforcement resources and replenish the national budget throughrestitution from corrupt oﬃcials. Critics viewed the measure as an avenue for corruptoﬃcials to escape prosecution for crimes committed prior to the 2022 invasion.In June 2022, the parliament adopted an anticorruption strategy through 2025 thatoutlines key performance indicators and monitoring instruments for governmentbodies. The new strategy reﬂects and instructs closer coordination among variousanticorruption institutions and government agencies, and prescribes public access toanticorruption monitoring and assessment reports.C3 0-4 pts"

Estimates in 2021 still showed that Ukraine’s budget was losing $37 billion ayear due to corruption. Asset declarations were weakened in 2020 as a result of aConstitutional Court decision; the court struck down the relevant law, and a new onewith diluted requirements was later enacted.Government transparency has further declined as a result of the ongoing war andmartial law. Parliamentary committee meetings are no longer open to the public asordinarily required by law; meeting locations, times, and agendas are no longerdisclosed in advance, ostensibly for security reasons.In May 2022, President Zelenskyy launched the “United 24” initiative to coordinatecharitable donations in support of Ukraine. Critics argued that while the initiative wasan eﬃcient way to coordinate foreign assistance, it oﬀered the president’s oﬃceanother means of centralizing authority, as the distribution of funds was believed to bethe responsibility of the cabinet, which is generally subordinate to the presidentialadministration.

TheRussian occupation authorities have also destroyed Ukrainian books and orderedteachers to inculcate the Kremlin’s version of history, deny the existence of theUkrainian nation, and cultivate Russian patriotism among Ukrainian schoolchildren.Ukrainian oﬃcials estimated that 1.2 million Ukrainians were forcibly taken to Russiaduring the year. Russian authorities also separated Ukrainian children from theirparents and abducted children from Ukrainian orphanages, hospitals, and otherinstitutions, forcibly transferring them to Russia. In May 2022, Russian presidentVladimir Putin signed a law that made it easier for Russians to adopt Ukrainian children;Russia otherwise bans foreign adoptions. The Russian government has also oﬀeredpayment to individuals for adopting children who become Russian citizens. Some480,000 Ukrainian children have been transferred from occupied regions of Ukraine—including Eastern Donbas—to Russia, according to estimates in Russian media outlets.Score Change: The score declined from 0 to −2 because Russian forces have sought toeliminate Ukrainian ethnic and national identity in areas under their control, in part byseizing or destroying cultural sites and materials, punishing use of the Ukrainianlanguage, and abducting and transferring hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian childrento Russia.Civil Liberties20/06/2024, 00:21Page 12 of 24"

Prior to the 2022 war, the media landscape featured considerablepluralism, open criticism of the government, and investigation of powerful ﬁgures.However, business magnates owned and inﬂuenced many outlets, using them as toolsto advance their agendas. A number of Russian news outlets and their journalists wereprohibited from entering the country. Various language laws require news outlets toproduce certain content in the Ukrainian language. Access to a number of Russian newschannels, websites, and social media platforms is banned; residents of Ukraine haveotherwise enjoyed unrestricted access to the internet.At the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022, the Ukrainian governmentconsolidated all television channels under a single government-controlled informationplatform, United News, that is broadcast around-the-clock on all channels in Ukraine. Inlate December 2022, Zelenskyy signed into law a controversial bill that expanded thegovernment’s control over print and online media, ostensibly to prevent the potentialspread of Russian propaganda.

A law adopted in 2017 was designed to align the country’s educationsystem with those in the EU, but it drew criticism for provisions that mandated the useof Ukrainian as the primary language of instruction in most publicly funded secondaryschools by 2020, aﬀecting numerous schools that taught in minority languages.In Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, occupation authorities forced Ukrainian teachersto follow the Russian school curriculum. Teachers reported that they had beenintimidated, threatened, and in some cases tortured for refusing to use the Russian-imposed curriculum. The Russian authorities have destroyed Ukrainian books andordered teachers to adhere to the Kremlin’s version of history, deny the existence ofthe Ukrainian nation, and cultivate Russian patriotism among Ukrainian schoolchildren."

Heated exchanges in the media andinstances of violence against those expressing views considered controversial are notuncommon, likely contributing to self-censorship among ordinary people.A week after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022,Ukrainian lawmakers amended the criminal code to expand grounds forcollaborationism charges, including public denial by a citizen of Ukraine of Russia’saggression, gloriﬁcation of the aggressor state, or insults to the honor and dignity ofUkrainian soldiers.

Zelenskyy ratiﬁed the law inAugust, adding a last-minute qualiﬁcation under pressure from trade unions that themeasure would only be applicable while the country was under martial law. It wasestimated that more than 70 percent of the Ukrainian workforce was aﬀected by thischange. The government claimed that the new code was meant to alleviate diﬃcultiesfaced by companies during wartime, but given that it was ﬁrst proposed in 2021, someargued that the government was exploiting the invasion to advance a deregulationagenda.Score Change: The score declined from 3 to 2 because changes to the labor coderestricted trade unions’ ability to represent workers and protect their rights while thecountry is under martial law."

In 2021,Zelenskyy tried to appoint two new judges to the Constitutional Court, which declinedto swear them in.In June 2022, the European Council granted Ukraine the status of candidate for EUmembership.

However, beginning in February, all regions of Ukraine were subjected toindiscriminate Russian missile and artillery strikes against both civilian and militarytargets. It was estimated that more than 15 percent of Ukrainian territory (includingCrimea) was under Russian occupation at year’s end. Invading Russian troops haveengaged in a range of human rights violations aﬀecting both civilians and combatants,including arbitrary detention and forced disappearance, torture, conﬂict-related sexualviolence, and other apparent war crimes. Evidence that Russian forces carried out amassacre of Ukrainian civilians in Bucha emerged in April. Estimates of the number ofUkrainian soldiers and civilians killed during the year varied widely. One ﬁgure, from theBritish Broadcasting Corporation, put the number of civilian deaths at 3,600 in June; byyear’s end the number was likely much higher.At the onset of the Russian invasion, Ukraine’s parliament adopted an emergencymeasure allowing civilians to receive ﬁrearms to defend against Russian aggression.Thousands of ﬁrearms were distributed among civilians in the Kyiv Region who joinedTerritorial Defense Forces to repel the Russian oﬀensive against the capital. Given theurgency of the situation, many of the ﬁrearms were not properly registered, meaningthe government does not have an accurate account of all weapons held by civilians. Atyear’s end the parliament was still considering a new law that would streamline theregistration of ﬁrearms. The traﬃcking of weapons and ammunition from the front linehad contributed to the proliferation of arms throughout Ukraine since 2014.In response to Ukrainian forces’ successful counteroﬀensives in the south andnortheast, Russian forces intensiﬁed long-distance strikes on civilian infrastructureacross the country in the last months of the year, leaving millions of Ukrainians withoutpower, heating, water, or adequate housing."

"women in the country face grave risks, an increased burden of caringresponsibilities and immense stress and hardships when living in warzones, Amnesty International said today, as the world marksInternational Women’s Day.“Time and time again, women bear the brunt of war’s brutality. They areconsistently on the frontlines of conﬂict – as soldiers and ﬁghters,doctors and nurses, volunteers, peace activists, carers for theircommunities and families, internally displaced people, refugees, and toooften as victims and survivors,” said Agnès Callamard, AmnestyInternational’s Secretary General.“Russia’s full-scale invasion in Ukraine is no different. Women confrontincreased sexual and gender-based violence and perilous healthconditions, while being forced to make life and death survival decisionsfor their families. At the same time, women are often excluded from thedecision-making processes and their rights and needs remainunprotected and unmet.” /uni00A0Amnesty International urges the international community to support andstand in solidarity with the women suffering human rights violationsamid Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine. Ensuring the safety andsecurity of civilians, in particular those caught up in the war zones, aswell as access to ﬁnancial aid and services including healthcare, is ofcrucial importance during times of war. Simultaneously, the perpetratorsof crimes under international law must be held to account.Amnesty International has been Amnesty International has been documenting war crimesdocumenting war crimes andlikely crimes against humanity committed in Ukraine and has gatheredharrowing testimony from women in Ukraine detailing the impact of theinvasion on their safety, health and well-being.‘There is no one to take care of them but me’While many women in Ukraine have joined the resistance to Russian20/06/2024, 00:43Page 2 of 9"
"While many women in Ukraine have joined the resistance to Russianaggression, very often caregiving responsibilities for children and familymembers fall disproportionately on women. Managing these caregivingresponsibilities is especially difﬁcult in the perilous conditions of theconﬂict.Tamara*, a woman living in the conﬂict zone in Donetsk Oblast, toldAmnesty International how the invasion has impacted her as a motherand caregiver for her parents: “All changed for the worse. Men [from thefamily] are at war, women are left alone, many with small children ontheir backs without any income. There is no help — no physical help, noﬁnancial aid.”Forced to choose between abandoning her parents and keeping herchildren safe, Tamara faced an impossible decision.“I came back to the danger zone with my kids. Maybe I did wrong. But Ineed to take care of my kids and my older parents [were] left at home —this is my duty. There is no one to take care of them but me. I have nochoice,” she said.For many women, travelling to safety can carry a devastating emotionaland physical toll. Maryna*, an internally displaced person who ﬂedRussia’s occupation of Donetsk Oblast with her children, told AmnestyInternational:“It is very hard. I am alone, and I have three children. Nobody believedthat war would come. It was a shock, and it was terrifying. There washeavy ﬁghting around, and we heard all of that. Russian military aircraftwere ﬂying so low that we could see the eyes of the pilots — it affectedchildren a lot.“Since that day, we lived in a basement for almost a month because thechildren were really scared.

There wererumours about evacuation and doctors leaving. I could not do theultrasound and all the tests. There simply was no access. That wasadding to the anxiety and emotional tension.”After ﬂeeing to Dnipro, Kateryna was faced with ongoing difﬁculties intrying to cope with a newborn baby while working in a conﬂict zone:“[The] front-line is moving closer to our city. Uncertainty is the mostterrifying aspect. Where will you be tomorrow? Will you be able to comehome? I lack psychological help and because of a small child, I do nothave enough time to talk with a psychologist, even by phone. But I feelthat I need it.”/uni00A0For menstruating women and girls, limited supplies and increased pricesfor menstruation management products are forcing them to choosebetween food and sanitary products.“There are pads and tampons for sale, but because of the troubles withﬁnances, I need to choose whether I buy food or pads.

"the full-scale invasion, I use improvised means,” Tamara said.Yulia*, whose home was destroyed by Russian air strikes, told AmnestyInternational that she was able to a collect menstrual products for herand her daughter at a support centre for internally displaced people..Increase in sexual and gender-based violenceGender-based violence is aggravated and intensiﬁed for those living inthe conﬂict-affected regions for many reasons. These include the lack ofsecurity, the absence or erosion of the rule of law, the pervasiveness ofimpunity for the perpetrators, and lack of trust in the occupyingauthorities, as well as the stigma attached to disclosing experiences ofsexual and gender-based violence.Maryna*, a humanitarian worker, told Amnesty International: “Sexualabuse is a huge problem for women. I participated in training, and wewere told that there were cases when children, [also], after theevacuation showed signs of having experienced sexual abuse.”While working at an assembly point for internally displaced people,Maryna witnessed escalations of domestic violence: “There were 60people living in a gym. I was working on this issue before but evenwithout my experience, [signs of violence] can be seen with the nakedeye. I saw a lot of it there.”Kateryna told Amnesty International: “I feel more vulnerable now. Thereare more conﬂicts at home. My husband’s aggression spilled out on meand my elder child. I cannot leave my children with my husbandbecause of the uncertainty throughout the day. He lost his job and nowmy husband is overwhelmed with emotion and nerves.”For Tamara these reports of sexual and gender-based violence are veryconcerning as a mother: “I constantly hear about violence, and it scaresme.

Related Sexual Violence in Ukraine
2018
2The Strategy for Prevention of and Response to the Conflict Related Sexual Violence in Ukraine was developed 
with the technical and financial support of the UN Women Ukraine and UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission 
in Ukraine in consultation with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister on European and Euro-Atlantic 
"Integration, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Justice of Ukraine."
United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women) is the UN 
organization dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of women. A global champion for women 
"and girls, UN Women was established to accelerate progress on meeting their needs worldwide."
UN Women supports UN Member States as they set global standards for achieving gender equality and works 
"with governments and civil society to design laws, policies, programmes and services needed to implement "
"these standards. It stands behind women’s equal participation in all aspects of life, focusing on five priority "
areas: increasing women’s leadership and participation; ending violence against women; engaging women 
in all aspects of peace and security processes; enhancing women’s economic empowerment; and making 
gender equality central to national development planning and budgeting. UN Women also coordinates and 
promotes the UN system’s work in advancing gender equality.
The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) is the UN entity with a mandate to promote 
"and protect the enjoyment and full realization, by all people, of all rights established in the Charter of the "
"United Nations and in international human rights laws and treaties. On 14 March 2014, at the invitation of the "
"Government of Ukraine, OHCHR deployed the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine "
"(HRMMU) to monitor the human rights situation in the country, and to provide public reports on the human "
rights situation and emerging concerns and risks. HRMMU is also mandated to recommend concrete follow-
"up actions to relevant authorities in Ukraine, the United Nations and the international community at large to "
"address human rights concerns, prevent human rights violations and mitigate emerging risks. "

In 2018 the Norwegian Nobel Committee made a decision to award the Nobel Peace Prize to Nadia Murad 
and Denis Mukwege for their efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war and armed conflict. 
"We celebrate these gender equality leaders, along with their care and trust of women. "
"Nadia Murad, a Yazidi human rights activist who was "
kidnapped by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL; 
also called ISIS) in August 2014 and sold into sex slavery. 
"She escaped three months later, and shortly thereafter "
she began speaking out about human trafficking and 
"sexual violence, especially as these issues pertained to "
Yazīdī women. She was appointed the United Nations’ 
Goodwill Ambassador for the Dignity of Survivors of 
Human Trafficking in 2016 and received several accolades. 
She has changed the understanding of the ordeals 
"faced by women and girls who are raped, tortured and "
exchanged among militants in war zones. Her voice has 
"been unfaltering in telling her story, constructively helping "
others to bring to light the hidden picture of rights denied 
and lives ruined.
"In 2018 she was a corecipient, with Congolese physician "
"Denis Mukwege, of the Nobel Prize for Peace"
"Denis Mukwege, a Congolese physician noted for "
his work in treating victims of sexual violence in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
"He founded the Panzi Hospital, where he served as "
director and chief surgeon. The hospital received large 
"numbers of sexual-assault victims, some as young "
as three years old and many with extreme injuries 
and mutilations. The “epidemic” of sexual violence 
in the conflict-ridden region was largely the result of 
combatants using the systematic rape of women and 
girls as a means of terrorizing and displacing the civilian 
"population. In response to the crisis, Mukwege created a "
"staff to specialize in the care of such patients, and since "
"1999 he and others have treated more than 50,000 "
women and children. 
"6“Stronger action is the need of the hour, and sexual violence in conflict "
is a front line concern for us. Reparations are routinely left out of peace 
"negotiations or sidelined in funding priorities, even though they are of "
utmost importance to survivors. We need to move this agenda forward 
in order to ensure real change in the lives of survivors who have seen 
the horrors of sexual violence in conflict up close”
UN Under-Secretary-General and Executive Director of UN Women  
Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka
“The establishment of the rule of law and transitional justice processes 
"are crucial to ensure accountability and to deliver justice, truth and "
reparations for violations suffered by women; they are also crucial to 
deter the continuation of such violations in the future.”
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (2008-2014)  
Navanethem Pillay
"In February 2017, the Human Rights Monitoring Mission of the Office of the High Commissioner on Human "
"Rights (HRMMU) in Ukraine released thematic report on conflict-related sexual violence in Ukraine, which "
"covers the period from March 2014 to January 2017. Apart from its findings, OHCHR made a number of "
"concrete recommendations to all parties to the conflict.1 Acting upon recommendations of this report, the "
Government of Ukraine expressed interest in prevention of the conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) and 
requested support from the United Nations (UN). This strategy is therefore developed to support Government 
in addressing the problems of CRSV.
1 Based on the cases documented by OHCHR recommendations formulated include immediate and medium-term measures to prevent 
"conflict-related sexual violence and respond to cases. Firstly, it recommends that the effects of the conflict on the rates of domestic "
"violence and trafficking need to be further examined. Secondly, Access to services and justice is particularly limited to survivors living in "
"the territory controlled by armed groups. Thirdly, It is critical to ensure that all allegations of human rights violations and abuses, including "
"sexual violence, are effectively investigated by law-enforcement and prosecuted in domestic courts. For specific recommendations "
"to the Government of Ukraine, all parties involved in the hostilities in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, including the armed groups of "
"‘Donetsk people’s republic’ and ‘Luhansk people’s republic’, to the Russian Federation and to international and donor community.  "
"Available at:  http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/UA/ReportCRSV_EN.pdf , pp. 34- 38"
7Background and general context
"In pre-conflict Ukraine, sexual and gender-based violence was under-reported due to stigma and a culture of "
silence; an inadequate legal framework to address SGBV; limited access to justice for victims and capacity of 
"the authorities to investigate, prosecute and held accountable perpetrators; and, broken referral pathways, "
including limited medical and psychosocial support services for victims and survivors. 
"These issues have become more evident with the conflict. For example, the gaps in the legislation, particularly "
"absence of clear definitions, along with the low capacity of law-enforcement to document and investigate "
"cases of sexual violence and the limited forensic services, are affecting the possible future prosecution for "
"sexual violence crimes related to the conflict.2 Additionally, the interchangeable use of terms (conflict-related "
"sexual violence, gender-based violence and domestic violence) by the Government of Ukraine, media, service "
providers contributes to confusion and makes it even more complex to determine the scale and scope of 
sexual violence linked to the conflict. 
Ukraine is going through an armed conflict since 2014 that continues with limited progress towards a lasting 
"peace.3 Since the very inception of the conflict, allegations of sexual violence have regularly surfaced in media "
"reports often presenting unverified facts, contributing to deepening the mistrust, divide and animosity among "
local communities. 
"In February 2017, Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (OHCHR) published a thematic report on "
conflict-related sexual violence covering the period between 14 March 2014 and 31 January 20174. The 
report highlighted the trends and patterns of sexual violence committed in the context of the conflict in the 
east and some cases in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea.
The majority of CRSV cases documented5 by OHCHR in Ukraine occurred in the context of the deprivation of 
"liberty on both sides of the contact line. In these cases, both men and women detained on conflict-related "
"charges6, were subjected to sexual violence to extract confession or information. Similar findings are contained "
in the reports released by Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group (2015) and the Coalition “Justice for Peace 
"in Donbas” (2017).7  However, this is only one pattern and more documentation efforts are needed to make "
visible other contexts in which CRSV might be occurring. 
NGO La Strada that provides psycho-social support to victims through inter alia the National Toll-Free Hot 
"Line on Prevention of Domestic Violence, Human Trafficking and Gender Discrimination noted that since the "
"beginning of the conflict the number of calls from territory controlled by armed groups, or from the areas near "
the contact line have been high. La Strada also noted that sometimes survivors do not articulate whatever 
happens to them as violence.

"3 International armed conflicts, opposing two or more states, non-international armed conflict is between governmental "
forces and nongovernmental armed groups or between such groups only. International Humanitarian law establishes 
a distinction between non international armed conflicts in the meaning of common Article 3 of Geneva conventions of 
1949 and non-international armed conflict falling within the definition provided in Article 1 of additional protocol 2[1]

"rights situation in Ukraine, which are available at:  http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/UA/ReportCRSV_EN.pdf"
6 The parties to the conflict most often detained the members of armed forces of the other side or those who were perceived to be otherwise 
affiliated to the other party of the conflict.  
7 Two NGO reports have referred to it. For details see http://library.khpg.org/files/docs/1451396610.pdf  
    and https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/unspoken-pain-gender-based-violence-conflict-zone-eastern-ukraine  
"8The deterioration of the economic situation, particularly in conflict-affected regions, combined with the "
"breakdown of community ties caused by the armed conflict and displacement, have compelled some people "
to use harmful survival strategies and coping mechanisms (sex for food or money) that may increase the risk 
of sexual violence and trafficking. 
"Trafficking in women and girls is exacerbated during and after conflict owing to the breakdown of political, "
economic and social structures especially due to high levels of violence and increased militarism. Conflict 
"and post-conflict situations can create war-related demand structures for women’s sexual, economic "
"exploitation. Conflict-affected regions can be areas of origin, transit and destination about trafficking in "
"women and girls, with the forms of trafficking varying by region, specific economic and political context "
"and State and non-State actors involved. In Ukraine, it has been an ongoing problem and possibilities of its "
"exacerbation exist. Therefore, it is important to include it all stages and in every component of the strategy."
"Finally, it is important to underline that conflict exacerbates gender-based violence, in particular against "
women and girls due to pre-existing discrimination and power imbalances in society. Discrimination based 
"on gender is deeply rooted and ingrained and it is often over looked and accepted as the norm. Also, "
"sexual minorities, especially in a conflict setting are particularly vulnerable. Therefore, to combat conflict "
"related sexual violence, it is essential to recognize gender-based violence and develop strategies to combat "
"discrimination and unequal treatment based on gender. If structural inequalities are not addressed, all "
attempts to tackle gender-based violence will remain superficial and service driven.
Existing gaps
"Since most actors do not really understand what CRSV is, it is difficult to estimate its scale and scope. Until "
now there is no official data available. 
National legislation and legal practice regarding the prosecution of sexual violence is limited and is not fully 
"in line with international standards and practice. For example, rape is defined only as sexual intercourse "
"between male and female. Other forms of sexual violence, such as forced pregnancy, forced sterilization "
are not criminalized. Sexual violence is rarely considered as torture. Due to a number of gaps in legislation 
"and a lack of capacity, acts of sexual violence are often recorded by law enforcement officers as other "
"crimes such as bodily injury. Therefore, the number of cases registered by law enforcement agencies cannot "
determine its prevalence. Detailed analysis of legal applicable framework both international and national is 
attached as annex 3. 
"Understanding of coercive environment (instead of consent) is not common, which makes it difficult to "
investigate conflict-related sexual violence8. Current legal system adds to the societal views since proving 
"rape is difficult. Overall gender stereotypes strengthen the notion of victim blaming, which deters victim "
from reporting.
The conflict has significantly affected service provision. There is still a lack of a comprehensive programme 
"to ensure that all survivors receive prompt and adequate access to an effective remedy, including gender "
"sensitive rehabilitation, restitution, compensation, satisfaction and guarantees of no recurrence. "
"8  In international criminal law and jurisprudence applicable to conflict-related sexual violence, the issue of consent is not inferior. Instead it is "
"necessary to prove that the crime took place in a coercive environment, in which such consent is not possible. "
9Framework and definitions
"In 2000, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) adopted resolution 1325, which calls for the increased "
participation of women and the incorporation of gender perspectives in all UN peace and security efforts 
"(including participation of women in decision-making and peace processes, gender perspectives in training and "
"peacekeeping and gender mainstreaming in UN reporting systems). Since then, the UN SC has adopted eight "
"more resolutions on women, peace and security, six of which also focus on conflict-related sexual violence.  9 "
"In 2008, it adopted landmark Resolution 1820 (2008) 10, the first devoted to addressing sexual violence in "
"conflict situations. The subsequent follow-up resolutions  1888 (2009), 1889 (2009), 1960 (2010), 2106 "
"(2013) have focused on preventing and responding to conflict-related sexual violence, and have established "
"the United Nations architecture11 to this end, including the appointment of the special representative on "
"sexual violence in conflict to provide leadership, strengthen existing UN coordination mechanisms and "
advocate on ending sexual violence against women with governments. Resolution 2106 requests the 
Secretary-General to report annually to the Security Council on the implementation of this mandate.
"Most of the resolutions call on parties to a conflict to take immediate measures to prevent and respond to CRSV, "
"including measures to end impunity for CRSV and to provide timely assistance to survivors. In June 2014, UN "
Guidance Note of the Secretary General on Reparations for Conflict Related Sexual Violence providing policy 
and operational guidance to establish effective and transformative reparation programmes for the victims of 
conflict related sexual violence was published.12

sexual and gender-based violence 
was considered an inevitable by-
product of war — not a crime to be 
prosecuted.
"After World War II, the charters of the"
International Military Tribunals at 
"Nuremberg and Tokyo, which were "
"established to prosecute wartime atrocities, "
did not explicitly recognize sexual and 
"gender-based crimes.Today,"
sexual and gender-based
crimes are considered especially 
grave violations of international 
law.
"They can be categorized as war crimes, "
"crimes against humanity, or acts of "
genocide depending on how the crimes
are committed and in what context. 
The same crime can also fall into 
multiple categories.
10Definitions
"CRSV refers to incidents or patterns of rape, sexual slavery, forced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced "
"sterilization and other forms of sexual violence of comparable gravity (forced nudity, forced marriage, forced "
"conjugation, forced abortion, indecent assault, trafficking, inappropriate medical examinations) against "
"women, men, girls and boys. Such incidents or patterns occur in conflict or post-conflict settings or other "
"situations of concern (e.g., political strife). They may have a direct or indirect nexus with the conflict or political "
"strife itself, i.e. a temporal, geographical or causal link. The link with the conflict may be evident in the profile "
"and motivations of the perpetrator(s), the profile of the victim(s), the climate of impunity/weakened state "
"capacity, cross-border dimensions or the fact that it violates the terms of a ceasefire agreement. The term also "
encompasses trafficking in persons when committed in situations of conflict for the purpose of sexual violence/
exploitation.
"Victims of CSRV include those who, individually or collectively, were subjected to such violence but also their "
"family members, such as children, parents or partners, children born as a result of a pregnancy from rape, and "
other people who depend on the victim.13
"Sexual violence is a serious human rights violation and abuse that may involve international crimes, particularly "
when committed in conflict.  It is a specific subset of broader term of sexual and other forms of gender-based 
violence 14.
13 Ibid
"14 The term «sexual and other forms of gender-based violence» comprises not only rape and attempted rape, but also sexual abuse, sexual "
"exploitation, forced early marriage, domestic violence, marital rape, trafficking and female genital mutilation."
""
"11Purpose, scope, objectives and development process of "
the Strategy
"Acting upon recommendations of the OHCHR thematic report on CRSV, the Government of Ukraine "
expressed interest in prevention and addressing CRSV.
"To support the Government of Ukraine, UN Women and HRMMU commissioned the development of "
the strategy based on the interest of Government of Ukraine. 
1. Purpose and scope of the Strategy
The present strategy provides guidance and recommendations on how governmental institutions 
"of Ukraine, civil society organizations, international organizations and UN system can join efforts to "
"effectively prevent and respond to CRSV. The document has a narrative part, which sets out the general "
"context, mandate and scope of the strategy, implementation mechanism, coordination mechanism and "
"tools. Second part of the document is a roadmap matrix that suggests specific objectives, actions for "
"specific actors to carry out to accomplish those objectives, leading to a more targeted approach. The "
"strategy is currently being developed at the initiative of government of Ukraine, applicable to whole "
"of Ukraine.15 All incidents of CRSV on Ukrainian territory within the scope of the strategy, include "
temporarily occupied territories by armed groups as self-proclaimed ‘Donetsk people’s republic’ and self-
"proclaimed ‘Luhansk people’s republic’ as well as Autonomous Republic of Crimea, which is currently "
occupied by Russian Federation.
It is proposed that the strategy or relevant aspects of the strategy are integrated in the National Action 
Plan on the Implementation of the UNSCR 1325 in Ukraine as it stems from UN Security Council 
"agenda on Women, Peace and Security and involves a number of actors who are already engaged in "
the implementation of NAP 1325. The coming mid-term evaluation of the NAP 1325 may represent an 
entry point for this integration.
2. Objectives of the Strategy
"•	Provide strategic, technical and policy advice to support institutions of the Government of Ukraine "
to understand and integrate better measures to prevent CSRV within existing mechanisms as well as 
through new mechanisms if required. 
"•	Systematic monitoring, documentation and investigation of CRSV, collecting evidence which will "
"pave the way for transitional justice processes, including access to justice and reparations for "
survivors. 
"•	Enhanced capacity of service providers, effective referral mechanisms and strengthened coordination "
system on CSRV for improved response.
"•	Increased awareness among communities and vulnerable groups about CRSV, available mechanisms "
for assistance and reporting.

123. Process of Strategy Development
The strategy has been developed through a consultative process with very broad range of actors from the 
"government, NGO’s and international organizations in Kyiv, Kramatorsk, and Sieverodonetsk."
These consultations were structured in a manner to learn about the experiences of the actors and getting 
"their inputs on the strategy. Upon completion of initial consultations, a workshop of key interlocutors was "
organized on 10 November 2017 in Kyiv in collaboration with Ministry of Justice to present the strategy 
and get their feedback before finalization.
"Over sixty participants attended the workshop from relevant government ministries, educational "
"institutions for prosecutors, judges and Ministry of Defence. Content of the strategy was presented and "
participants worked in working groups to discuss the pillars of the strategy and gave their inputs. 
"The strategy is accompanied by a roadmap with more specific actions, for example, the names of potential "
"actors responsible to carry out the recommendations. The strategy is perceived as a multi-faceted, living "
"document, which will influence several interconnected plans and policies. "
 
13Description of the Strategy
1. Four components of the Strategy
"Through consultation process, needs and gaps were identified in prevention and response to "
conflict related sexual violence. Lack of knowledge and understanding emerged as one of the key 
gaps. Prevention of CRSV and protection from CRSV are key to any conflict context. They were 
recognized as the critical areas in Ukraine too. Most interlocutors identified that it is not recognized 
and is under reported because most victims do not think they can get justice. 
"Based on the priorities identified during the consultation process, four components have been "
identified for the strategy.
1. Understanding CRSV and gathering information
2. Prevention
3. Protection
4. Access to Justice
Component 1: Understanding CRSV and information gathering.
There is little understanding currently on conflict related sexual violence among specialists as well as 
the public in general. Most people are not aware of what amounts to CRSV and why it is considered 
"a separate category. Most people use terms like gender-based violence, domestic violence and "
"conflict related sexual violence interchangeably including service providers, law enforcement "
"agencies, NGO’s and international organizations. Therefore, it is not surprising that there is no "
"reporting of CRSV. Even if it is reported, it is hardly recognized and documented as CRSV."
 
"To tackle this problem, the following action is suggested:"
• Proposed Strategy should be presented and discussed in a broad circle of stakeholders - 
government authorities NGO’s and international organizations. It would be also beneficial 
"for the Government to endorse the Strategy, ideally in the frame of existing mechanism, "
e.g. National Action Plan for the Implementation of the UNSCR 1325.  Demonstrating its 
"commitment, the government will allocate some resources for this work and seek support "
from international organizations and donors. 
"• Standard Operating Procedure for identification, engagement and documentation. "
Development of standard operating procedure for engagement with survivor of CRSV 
should be initiated. The purpose of this should be to empower and encourage survivors to 
"report such violation without discrimination, stigmatization and secondary victimization, "
14without being forced to cooperate with law enforcement agencies.16 This will be essential 
to encourage victims of CRSV to report in confidential manner without the fear that 
reporting sexual violence will mean obligatory collaboration with law enforcement 
agencies . These discussions will lead to some policy guidelines for all relevant actors 
to be able to adapt their role and services to make them more conducive to reporting 
of CRSV. It is recommended that standard operating procedures be based on already 
existing documents. The International Protocol on the Documentation and Investigation 
"of Sexual Violence in Conflict, the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) Guidelines "
for Integrating Gender-Based Violence Interventions in Humanitarian Action (2015) 17; 
and the World Health Organization (WHO) (2007) are to be consulted.18 
"• Material production. It is suggested that after endorsement of the strategy, a multi-"
disciplinary working group is formed to work on the material for education and 
information campaign and material developed by the working group should form the basis 
"of all the educational programmes, trainings of different target groups and information "
campaigns. This material should be based on existing international documents mentioned 
"above, which are to be adapted to Ukraine’s context. This will help in keeping the precise "
understanding of the subject matter. It is important to understand in the process of 
"identifying action, gathering information and developing materials that CRSV is a specific "
"form of GBV which has distinct implications for the survivor psychologically, physically "
"and legally, therefore needs to be recognized and dealt with in comprehensive manner. "
Sexual violence is also prohibited under IHL.
• Multi-sectoral education programmes. Education programmes should be designed to 
train relevant actors and CRSV education should become part of ongoing training and 
"education programmes of military, police, border guards, national guards, prosecutors "
and judges through integration in their curriculum.
• Undertaking research activities to generate for information on CRSV. It is recommended 
"that government, civil society partners and international organizations undertake research "
to understand CRSV better. It is also important to highlight that studying the linkages with 
trafficking are of crucial importance given high prevalence of trafficking in the region.
Component 2: Prevention
Prevention of CRSV is closely linked to two aspects in Ukraine. One is absence of knowledge and 
"information regarding what is CRSV and what potential harm it can cause to the survivor, second "
is lack of faith regarding getting justice through existing mechanisms. Prejudices and stereotypical 
"notions regarding victims of sexual violence, which speculate about their ‘morality’, discourages "
them to report this crime as they fear being blamed for it. Many do not understand it and 
blame themselves for it. Potential perpetrators are not aware of the seriousness of the crime and

15somewhere have a sense of privilege that they will not be punished for it. General frustration with 
justice institutions prevails which adds to the ongoing sense of impunity.
Heavy military presence on combat duties in civilian areas creates an environment susceptible for 
CRSV. Dire economic condition of local population combined with collapse of social structures and 
lack of options makes very easy for young women and girls finding themselves in situation of sex 
work. This may seem voluntary on the surface but a close review of situation considering extreme 
vulnerabilities and dependence of local populations and heavy imbalance of power towards armed 
personnel may highlight presence of potential coercive elements as identified in international law.  
"Therefore, the problem is at two levels, acknowledgement and awareness. Once the problem of "
"CRSV is acknowledged, the next step is to dissemination of this information as everywhere as "
possible.
"Given the situation, following steps are recommended:"
• Inclusion of “sexual violence” in code of conduct of all security agencies and armed forces. 
Sexual violence should be included as prohibited conduct in the code of conduct of all 
"security agencies and armed forces. With clear definition, the code of conduct will inform "
what such conduct amounts to and state the prohibition for all service men and women. 
"I-Strategic Command Directive 040-001 of NATO, appropriate conduct is described with "
the purpose of integrating UNSCR 1325 and other relevant resolutions.  With regards 
to sexual conduct it suggests “Sexual relationships when based on inherently unequal 
""
16power dynamics are strongly discouraged and may not only undermine the credibility and 
integrity of the work of the Alliance but also be prohibited under national regulations 
or local law”19. It will be of significant importance to consider NATO standards while 
reviewing code of conduct.
• Clear administrative instructions on CRSV. All agencies in security and defence sector should 
"have clear administrative orders specifying what may amount to CRSV, what procedure "
will be followed for investigation and upon being found guilty what administrative 
punishment may follow. It is important to understand that currently Criminal Code of 
Ukraine does not criminalise all types of conflict related sexual violence. Even definition 
of rape in national legislation is not in line with international standards and practice. 
"Only referring the case for criminal investigation may not lead to a conclusion. Therefore, "
"until the law is amended to adhere to international standards, it will be important to set "
administrative measures in security forces to prevent and address CRSV. As clear from the 
"term itself, the measures will be administrative in nature and so will be the punishment. "
"Punishment may amount to dismissal from service, suspension from service, fine, no "
promotion or removal from position of responsibility depending on the seriousness of 
"the offence. This should not be linked to criminal trial, which may or may not lead to "
conviction.
• Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for implementation of administrative instructions. 
"For implementation of above-mentioned administrative instructions, clear SOP should be "
"developed. This will outline how the investigation will be conducted, the threshold of "
"evidence, confidentiality of the process, link between the gravity of offence and suggested "
measure and protection of complainant.
"• Revision of curriculum of security sector, social protection sector and Law enforcement. "
"Ukraine has dedicated institutions to train police, military, national guard, border guard, "
"prosecutors, judges, social workers and health personnel. It is important that all these "
"education institutions integrate CRSV in a holistic manner. Therefore, it is recommended "
"that the curriculum be reviewed in thorough manner for including prevention, protection "
and response aspects.
• Educating personnel in security forces about CRSV and its implications. Sufficient 
education will be provided to security personnel to ensure that they are well aware of 
individual responsibility as well as command responsibility in relation to CRSV. It is part 
of command responsibility to not only put a mechanism in place but to ensure that all 
personnel are aware of the mechanism. It is extremely important to educate security 
personnel on consent and how it is viewed in international law between civilians and 
military during conflict. NATO standards of education in relation to gender and UNSCR 
1325 will provide required standards and methodology.
• Information campaign on CRSV. An important component of prevention is adequate 
information for all including those who may become potential victims as well as potential 
perpetrators. An information campaign on CRSV should be launched particularly in the 
conflict area and among IDP communities who are moving from these areas to other 
"areas. From experience in other places, it has been established that those providing health "
"19 Integrating UNSCR1325 and gender perspective in to NATO command structure, BI-STRATEGIC COMMAND DIRECTIVE 040-001 "
"(PUBLIC VERSION), October 17, 2017"
"17care and psychological support are first point of contact for survivors, it is essential that "
all civilian populations in the conflict area as well as IDP’s are aware of these contacts. 
Population affected by the conflict should be aware of actions that may amount to CRSV. 
Information campaign will be designed in a manner that it reaches all sections of the 
"society. Mainstreaming the campaign through social media, television and print media "
"will be important. Celebrities, Ukrainian or foreign, promoting CRSV will help dissociating "
stigma from reporting. Partnerships with business houses can be considered for expanding 
the scope of campaign.  It will be useful to dedicate sixteen days of activism campaign 
in 2018 to CRSV. It will provide an opportunity to highlight the issue across different 
sectors and will open possibilities for learning. District level media should also be used to 
information campaign.
• Livelihood programmes for the communities affected by conflict. Targeted livelihood 
programmes should be started for the communities that have been pushed to poverty 
and unemployment due to the conflict including those who have moved from the other 
side of the contact line. A number of coercive sexual contacts can take place when the 
"civilian population’s economic situation is desperate. As a long-term intervention, it is "
important to start livelihood programmes for the communities as a preventive measure 
to CRSV.
• Adaptation of early warning indicators to Ukraine’s context and dissemination. UN 
"Action, in collaboration with UN Women, OHCHR the Office of the SRSG-SVC and the "
Office of the Special Advisor on the Prevention of Genocide has developed Early Warning 
Early Response indicators20. These indicators can be adapted to Ukrainian context and 
"widely disseminated among service providers, civil military units and local administration "
in affected areas to be able to use them.
• Capacity building of NGO’s and international organizations. NGO’s play an important 
"role in educating communities. Therefore, it is important that UN agencies, and other "
"thematic expert groups take this responsibility to train NGOs, international organizations "
and social workers to ensure prevention. 
Component 3: Protection and response
"In the absence of recognition of the problem, there are hardly any specific protection and response "
mechanisms in place for CRSV and its survivors. Most services available are developed for domestic 
violence survivors.  The services are few for the broad categories that they cover. There are hardly 
any services available on the other side of the contact line and little information is available regarding 
"the situation of overall gender-based violence. The problem is at two levels, first one is related "
"services provided for gender-based violence are not sufficient and secondly, those that exist do not "
sufficiently factor in sexual violence. Available services operate on the assumption that all survivors 
are women and it is very difficult for men to approach these services. Referral pathways are not 
fully in place.
"In these situations, following actions are recommended:"
20 Matrix: Early-Warning Indicators of Conflict-Related Sexual Violence. Available at:  
https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/MatrixEarlyWarningIndicatorsCSV_UNAction2011.pdf 
18• Formal acknowledgement of the problem. It is important that the government of Ukraine 
"adopts through the process of colloquium, agreed definitions and instructions, CRSV as a "
"specific category of violation, committed on either side of contact line.  Referral pathways "
should be established in the conflict areas and where IDP populations are located. It should be 
made possible for survivors and victims to access assistance without fear and stigmatization.
• Medical assistance. Medical assistance should be made available for all victims without linking 
"it to reporting. As explained earlier, fear of mandatory reporting may discourage victims from "
reporting it. The victim should also have the choice to either approach a governmental service 
provider or NGO; confidential medical assistance must be made available to all survivors. 
WHO’s clinical management guidelines for rape survivors highlight that the survivor has a 
right to privacy and self-determination and no measures should be taken without the consent 
of the survivor.21
21 World Health Organization/United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Clinical management of rape survivors-Developing protocols 
"for use with refugees and IDP’s. Revised edition, 2004. Available at: https://www.unhcr.org/403a0b7f4.pdf "
""
19• Psychological assistance. It is crucial for supporting survivors of CRSV. It should be made 
"available in confidential manner through variety of service providers, including government "
and NGO’s. These services should be sensitive enough to receive both male and female clients. 
Psychological assistance that is provided to torture victims and those who have been detained 
should be sensitive to the possibility of sexual abuse. 
• Legal assistance. It should be made available to survivors of CRSV free of cost through 
government’s free legal aid system. Such survivors should be included in the list of those who 
are eligible free legal assistance by the government.
• Civilian military contact. There are many efforts being made to build relationship of trust 
"between military and civilians, which is commendable. Along with these efforts, the norms "
under IHL should be strictly observed. It should be ensured that mandatory distance from 
schools and hospitals is observed and armed personnel should not enter either school or 
hospital in any condition.
• Protecting youth and children through education. It is suggested that Ministry of education 
improves sex education for teenaged children and young adults and develops creative and 
non-judgmental curriculum. They should be able to learn the risks as well as measures to 
protect themselves in case of sexual contacts. It is important that the education helps children 
and young adults understand consent and to be able to recognize abuse. There should also be 
possibility of referral for teenaged children for psychological support.
• Rehabilitation programmes for survivors. It is important to have a comprehensive programme 
in pace for survivors of CRSV irrespective of legal action. This programme should include short-
"term support like medical assistance, psychological assistance, legal assistance, shelter and "
support in employment and reintegration in society.
• Strengthening of existing hotlines and act on patterns. Hotlines are being used in Ukraine as a 
"method of providing for assistance to victims of different forms of violence, abuse and threats "
"including domestic violence, violence against women, trafficking and sometimes also for intra "
departmental abuse of power and other types of harassment. It is extremely important to 
sensitize the providers of these hotline services whether they belong to government or NGO’s.
• Coordination. This is a key to effective protection strategies and to utilize resources in best 
possible manner. Coordination mechanisms are essential at national as well as oblast level to 
"ensure effective implementation. As mentioned above, such mechanism goals are integral to "
formal endorsement of the strategy.
• Effective referral mechanism.  Effective referral mechanism is a key to adequate response to 
"any form of gender-based violence which is confidential, non-judgmental and easily available "
to survivors of such violence. Such referral pathways in traditional humanitarian emergencies 
are under GBV sub cluster of protection cluster. GBV sub-clusters are present in conflict-
"affected areas however they are targeted at women only, while men can also be a victim "
of sexual violence in conflict. Using existing mechanisms is a proficient way to developing 
response without having to set in place additional mechanism. It is recommended that referral 
mechanism for CRSV be developed within the framework of GBV sub cluster or any other 
existing referral mechanism. 
20Component 4: Access to justice for victims and survivors
"At present, since there is no acknowledgement "
of CRSV as a problem and it is only understood 
"as rape, there is hardly any provision for seeking "
justice and accountability. Existing legal system 
is not suited to prosecute the different types 
of CRSV and is not adapted to the situation of 
conflict. Reporting gender-based violence of any 
type is considered a taboo and legal system does 
not support victims in a manner to enable them 
to report. General trust in judiciary is low and not 
many people access the justice system for their 
problems. Problems of attitude also restrict law 
enforcement agencies from taking forward cases of 
gender-based violence. The system lacks technical 
capacities and requires better resources to be able 
to meet the workload it has. It is not perceived free 
from corruption by the ordinary people. 
"As described in the section earlier on legal scope, "
the laws are not equipped to deal with the 
situation of conflict given the limited scope of the 
definition and evidentiary requirements. Medical 
evidence is considered essential for prosecution 
"of rape, which makes it impossible for victims to "
"prosecute in situation of conflict, displacement and "
deprivation of liberty. Understanding of justice and 
accountability is limited to prosecution only.
"Given the situation, the following action is suggested: "
• Documentation of cases of CRSV.  It is extremely important that CRSV is addressed and 
"documented in a comprehensive manner with as much detail as possible, using the same "
"methodology. As discussed earlier, it must be based on survivor’s informed consent. It is important "
to note here that it is NOT necessary to build a database of information but encourage reporting 
and allowing survivors to choose the actor they feel most comfortable with to report. More than 
"centralization of information, it is important to follow common understanding of the concept "
and use the same methodology.
• Request for voluntary submission of cases for legal action.  As suggested earlier that it is not 
possible to prosecute various types of CRSV in current circumstances however information will 
be gathered by several entities. Once there is amendment in the law and necessary measures are 
"in place, a public announcement will be made asking those who wish to pursue legal recourse "
to come forward. This will be voluntary process. The information will be disseminated at large 
scale and a confidential system will be set up for survivors to approach. 
• Reparations programme for victims and communities.  In the process of implementation 
"of the strategy, it is important to discuss and design reparation programmes for victims and "
communities. 
""
"21• Based on principles outlined in SG’s guidance note on reparations, a discussion should be initiated "
to design reparations programmes for victims of CRSV. It may be linked to broader process of 
transitional justice and other forms of violations suffered during conflict or otherwise. Reparations 
programmes are often initiated through truth commissions which go through detailed discussions 
"and gather information in the process of truth seeking (South Africa, Guatemala, Peru) however "
"in many instances this has not been the responsibility of truth commissions (Argentina, Brazil and "
Germany). 
"• It will be beneficial for Ukraine to hold consultations with affected communities, civil society and "
experts before deciding on the format and reach the best possible solution for the Ukrainian 
context. It is important to note that it is recommended that reparation programmes be initiated as 
soon as possible to support survivors before the harm becomes irreparable. End of the conflict or 
peace agreements are not a pre-condition for reparations programmes. It is recommended that 
the Government of Ukraine initiate the programme for survivors of CRSV along with survivors of 
other forms of violations. Prosecution of the crime is also not essential for reparations and survivor’s 
will must be respected in this context. It is important for Ukraine to consider a comprehensive 
programme that clearly defines the process of identification and verification of beneficiaries of such 
programmes. 
"• Amendment of national legislation in line with international law.  As mentioned above, "
Ukraine’s legislation is not compatible to international law and is not equipped to investigate sexual 
"violence effectively, especially in conflict. It is essential that existing legislation be amended to "
ensure that cases of CRSV can be prosecuted without unrealistic expectations in terms of evidence 
and definition. It is also an obligation under Ukraine’s international commitments. Expediting the 
process will facilitate the quest for justice for victims of sexual violence. OHCHR report provides 
specific recommendations for articles of criminal code and evidence law that require amendment 
"to ensure effective prosecution of sexual violence, including in conflict. Law reform process will "
benefit from referring to these recommendations. It is important to define rape as per international 
"definition, include the element of coercion and encourage courts to use other forms of evidence "
"like victim and witness testimonies, physical evidence from the site of crime and documentary "
evidence than only relying on immune - biological test and forensic examination of victim’s body 22.
• Building capacity of law enforcement agencies to work on CRSV.  From amendment in the 
law to change in attitudes of law enforcement machinery is a process and experience shows that 
it takes significant amount of time to change the biases and stereotypes that hamper the access 
for survivors. It is useful that the work of capacity development is started and specific attention 
is paid changing stereotypes. Instructions should be issued to all law enforcement agencies on 
"how to investigate CRSV, ill treatment and torture based on Istanbul protocol and protocol on "
documentation and investigation of CRSV23. 
"• Prosecution of CRSV.  With the specific focus and CRSV, upon amendment in the legislation, it "
should be discussed whether there is need for specialized courts to prosecute CRSV or it can be done 
within the existing court system. Gender sensitive measures should be included in the proceedings 
"like testifying through video, presence of a trusted person during cross-examination."
22 Some of these recommendations were considered during when amendments were introduced to the Criminal Code in December 2017
"23 The Manual on Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, "
"commonly known as the Istanbul Protocol, is the first set of international guidelines for documentation of torture and its consequences. It "
became an official United Nations document in 1999. For details see: http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/training8Rev1en.pdf .

Survivors have a right
to justice under international law
The path to justice can take many forms:
"National, regional and interna -"
tional courts can hold individuals 
criminally responsible for their 
"actions, and sentence them to "
punishment.
Truth commissions report on past 
"human rights violations, often by "
taking statements and holding 
public hearings with both victims 
and perpetrators of atrocities.
Reparations include com -
"pensation, restitution of "
"property, physical and "
psychological rehabilitation 
"for victims, and reforms "
to ensure violations do not 
recur.Case Example
Case Example
"Case ExampleIn 2016, a Guatemalan court convicted two "
former military officers of sexual and gen -
der-based crimes against humanity against 
indigenous Q’ eqchi’ women. This was the first 
prosecution of sexual slavery in a national 
court using international criminal law.
"In 2015, a truth commission in Canada "
reported on the country’s residential school 
"system for indigenous children, which sepa -"
rated children from their families to destroy 
indigenous cultures. The report linked pres -
ent-day violence against indigenous women to 
risk factors including racism and poverty — 
the legacy of the residential schools.
Colombia’s Victims and Land Restitution Law 
provides assistance and reparations to victims 
of the country’s decades-long conflict. The 
2011 law includes special measures to pro -
tect women’s rights and gives female heads of 
"household priority access to land restitution, "
"credit, education, training and subsidies.Criminal"

232. Timeframe for the strategy implementation
"Given the objectives, which are a combination of short term and long-term goals, the strategy looks at proposed "
action in three phases and with four key components for a period of seven year sustained and systematic 
action. This process will enable comprehensive and meaningful action to prevent and address CRSV.
"The strategy is in favour of sticking with the following timeline, divided in three phases:"
• Phase one: Preparation and paving the way
First phase will focus on increased understanding of the issue across sectors and identification of appropriate 
"actors to prevent and respond to CRSV. During this period, it is expected that different sectors will be able to "
"discuss, understand the issue, identify actors within every sector, and define clear roles and responsibilities. "
During this phase mapping of resources that are available should also take place to capitalize on all the 
available resources.
"• Phase two: Implementation and action, 3 years"
"During this phase, it is expected that both government and civil society will be able to integrate CRSV in their "
response systems. Security sector will put in place administrative action against those responsible for CRSV. 
Preventive measures will focus on raising awareness of all sections of society especially in the conflict zone.
"• Phase three: Consolidation, 2 Years"
This phase will build upon the last two phases and it is envisaged that Ukraine will have sufficient judicial 
mechanisms to ensure accountability for past crimes of CRSV. This phase will design and implement 
comprehensive reparations programmes for survivors of CRSV.
It is important to understand that the phases are not strictly going to focus on one specific component of the 
"strategy, but all components are interconnected and working on one is bound to feed to and link to the other."

Countries
and territories are
"affected by fragility,  "
conflict and violence.People
Source: World BankSexual and gender-based violence is a pervasive human 
rights violation
"While anyone can experience violence, unequal power relationships and entrenched gender inequalities "
have a disparate impact on women and girls.
This violence is especially prevalent 
in times of insecurity or conflict and 
under regimes with no recourse to 
justice.
"29Under international law, acts of sexual violence incur State responsibility, the responsibility of the parties to the "
"conflict, as well as individual criminal liability.25 Under customary international law,26 rape and other forms of "
"sexual violence are prohibited in both international and non-international armed conflicts.27 Article 3, common "
"to the four Geneva Conventions prohibits “violence to life and person”, including cruel treatment and torture "
"and “outrages upon personal dignity”, which includes sexual violence.28"
The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court is the first international instrument to expressly define 
various forms of sexual violence as underlying acts of both crimes against humanity and war crimes committed 
"during international and non-international armed conflicts. These acts include rape29, sexual slavery30, enforced "
"prostitution31, forced pregnancy32, enforced sterilization33, and other forms of sexual violence of comparable "
"gravity 34. In these cases, a perpetrator commits an act of a sexual nature against a person, or causes another to "
"engage in such an act, by force, or by threat of force or coercion, such as that caused by fear of violence, duress, "
"detention, psychological oppression or abuse of power, or by taking advantage of a coercive environment or a "
"person’s incapacity to give genuine consent. 35 An act of sexual nature is not limited to physical violence, and "
"may even not involve any physical contact, for example forced nudity or forcing to observe an act of sexual "
violence.36
"In accordance with international jurisprudence, sexual and gender-based crimes may constitute acts of "
"genocide or other acts of crimes against humanity or war crimes, such as torture, mutilation, persecution, "
"inhuman acts, and outrages upon personal dignity.37"
"For committing the crimes within the jurisdiction of the International criminal Court, the Rome Statute envisages "
"various forms of responsibility, including that of commanders and superiors.38 Under article 25, a person shall "
"25 International Criminal Court (ICC) Statute, Article 25(3) (Individual criminal responsibility) and Article 28 (Responsibility of commanders and "
other superiors).
"26 Henckaerts, Doswald-Beck, Customary International Law, Volume II Rules 93, 94, 134, and 156."
"27 The prohibition of “outrages upon personal dignity”, “violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment "
"and torture” is recognized in Additional Protocols I and II, as well as Article 3 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, as a fundamental guarantee "
for civilians and persons hors de combat. Article 75 of Additional Protocol I specifies that this prohibition covers in particular “humiliating and 
"degrading treatment, enforced prostitution and any form of indecent assault”, while article 4 of Additional Protocol II specifically adds “rape” "
"to this list. Article 27 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states that all protected persons “shall at all times be humanely treated, and shall be "
protected especially against all acts of violence or threats thereof and against insults and public curiosity. Women shall be especially protected 
"against any attack on their honour, in particular against rape, enforced prostitution, or any form of indecent assault”."

"where the victim engages in an act of a sexual nature as a result of fear of violence, duress, detention, psychological oppression or abuse of "
power.

parties to the conflict in Ukraine.

"Apart from these Ukraine is also party to several conventions of Council of Europe, which are relevant. "
"They are Council of Europe Convention for Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (1950), "
ratified in 1997 Council of Europe Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings (CET197)

National laws and legal practice for prosecution of sexual violence is limited in Ukraine and not in accordance 
with international law.42 There is no explicit definition of gender-based and/or sexual violence in Ukrainian 
legislation. Article 1 of the Law of Ukraine “On Ensuring Equal Rights and Opportunities for Women and 
"Men” defines sexual harassment as sexual acts expressed verbally (threats, intimidation, indecent remarks) "

National law and jurisprudence defines rape as sexual intercourse between individuals of different sex

"31of the victim’s helpless condition.43 This definition does not cover same-sex rape. Therefore, unless the "
"perpetrator is a woman, men and boys will not be considered as victims of rape. Furthermore, investigators "
"and courts interpret the “helpless condition” in a restrictive manner, lacking any notion of coercive "
"circumstances or inability to give genuine consent, which is of particular importance in contexts of armed "
conflict. 44
"The Criminal Code of Ukraine includes five articles pertaining to sexual violence: on rape (Article 152), on "
"violent unnatural gratification of sexual desire (Article 153), on compulsion to sexual intercourse (Article "
"154), on sexual intercourse with a sexually immature person (Article 155), and on corruption of minors "
"(Article 156). Articles 152, 153, 155, and 156may be applicable regardless of the relation of the victim "
to the perpetrator. Article 154 applies only to situations where a victim is financially dependent on a 
"perpetrator, or is subordinate to the perpetrator; this is rarely applied to sexual violence in conflict setting. "
The Article 156 can be applied only if the victim is younger than 16 years. The Criminal Code includes the 
crimes of sexual exploitation and forced pregnancy but only in connection with human trafficking (Article 
"149), thereby limiting the application. Depending on the circumstances, the above-mentioned crimes may "
be punishable from three to 15 years of imprisonment.
"The Criminal Code contains two articles, which could be applied specifically to cases of conflict-related "
sexual violence. Paragraph 1 of article 433 envisages criminal responsibility for violence against the civilian 
"population in a conflict area, which may include sexual violence, and is punishable with three to eight years "
"of imprisonment. Article 438 foresees criminal responsibility for the violation of laws and customs of war, "
"which includes cruel treatment of prisoners of war or civilians (and thus may include sexual violence), and "
shall be punishable by imprisonment from 8 to 12 years.
The Criminal Code of Ukraine mainly focuses on individual criminal responsibility for physical commission 
"of a crime or aiding, abetting or otherwise assisting the commission of the crime. Articles 426 (omission "
"of military authority – failure to prevent or refer a case to investigation, or other failure to act by a person "
in authority which caused significant harm) and 4261(actions in excess of military authority) also foresee 
"command responsibility, which includes elements of omission liability, and is of particular importance "
in the context of armed conflict. These articles however are mainly applied in cases when commanders 
"commit crimes against their subordinates, and are rarely applied to conduct against civilians."

34Annex 5. Glossary of Terms46
* Disclamer
The glossary does not have any legal effects and will serve as a reference tool in connection with 
the Strategy for Prevention of and Response to the Conflict Related Sexual Violence (CRSV). The term 
victim and survivor are used interchangeably based on the context and consequences to the individuals 
affected.
Conflict-related sexual violence
Conflict-related sexual violence refers to incidents or (for SCR 1960 listing purposes) patterns of sexual 
"violence, that is rape, sexual slavery, forced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization, or any "
"other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity, against women, men, girls or boys. Such incidents "
"or patterns occur in conflict or post-conflict settings or other situations of concern (e.g., political "
"strife). They also have a direct or indirect nexus with the conflict or political strife itself, i.e. a temporal, "
geographical and/or causal link. In addition to the international character of the suspected crimes (that 
"can, depending on the circumstances, constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity, acts of torture or "
"genocide), the link with conflict may be evident in the profile and motivations of the perpetrator(s), the "
"profile of the victim(s), the climate of impunity/weakened State capacity, cross-border dimensions and/"
or the fact that it violates the terms of a ceasefire agreement.47
Gender-based violence
An umbrella term for violence directed toward or disproportionately affecting someone because of their 
actual or perceived gender identity. The term ‘gender-based violence’ is primarily used to underscore 
"the fact that structural, gender-based power differentials around the world place women and girls "
"at risk for multiple forms of violence. This includes acts that inflict physical, sexual or mental harm or "
"suffering, threats of such acts, coercion, and other deprivations of liberty, whether occurring in public "
"or in private life. While women and girls suffer disproportionately from GBV, men and boys can also "
"be targeted. The term is also used by some actors to describe targeted violence against lesbian, gay, "
"bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) populations, in these cases when referencing violence related "
to norms of masculinity/femininity and/or gender norms.
Victim
"Commonly understood, a person who is, or has been, sexually exploited or abused. "
"Comment: Different definitions of victim trigger different consequences; therefore, it is important to use "
them contextually.

Survivor
Reference is made to the term “victim” above. ‘Victim’ is a term often used in the legal and medical 
"sectors, while the term ‘survivor’ is generally preferred in the psychological and social support sectors to "
a person who has experienced sexual or gender-based violence because it implies resilience. 
Violence against women 
"Any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological "
"harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, "
"whether occurring in public or in private life. Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, "
"but not be limited to, the following: (a) Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, "
"including battering, sexual abuse of female children in the household, dowry-related violence, marital "
"rape, female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women, non-spousal violence "
"and violence related to exploitation; (b) Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring within "
"the general community, including rape, sexual abuse, sexual harassment and intimidation at work, in "
"educational institutions and elsewhere, trafficking in women and forced prostitution; (c) Physical, sexual "
"and psychological violence perpetrated or condoned by the State, wherever it occurs."

UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINEEXECUTIVE SUMMARY
"1. In summer of 2015, UNFPA commissioned a survey "
on gender-based violence (GBV) in the conflict-
"affected regions of eastern Ukraine, in particular "
in the government-controlled areas of Donetsk 
"and Lugansk oblasts, and in Dnipropetrovsk, "
"Zaporizhzhya and Kharkiv oblasts, those which "
host the main influx of internally displaced persons 
(IDPs). The survey tasks were focused on reviewing 
the available administrative data on related criminal 
"offences, content analysis of secondary data on "
"GBV, conducting a special sample population "
"survey on GBV issues, focus group discussions with "
representatives of local communities and in-depth 
interviews with key informants (experts involved into 
various aspects of GBV response in the regions of 
the study). 
2. Administrative data on GBV describes only the “tip 
"of the iceberg”, as only a few survivors usually ask "
"for help due to social and cultural barriers, failing "
legislation and overly institutionalized environment. 
In the conditions of an on-going conflict and the loss 
"of control by central authorities over large territories, "
"the reliability of administrative data is declining, as "
the registered crime rates are influenced by problems 
with the statistical audit of criminal offences and 
total population numbers. The regions of the study 
have been traditionally characterized by high crime 
rates; intensive fighting in Donetsk and Lugansk 
oblasts and large-scale flows of IDPs resulted in a 
further aggravation of the crime situation there. 
Even accounting for the significant underreporting 
"of criminal offenses, a small increase in the number "
of registered rapes was observed in the regions 
bordering the antiterrorist operation (ATO) area; the 
number of women surviving theft and fraud has also 
grown. 
3. The problem of GBV in the conflict setting has 
gained largescale public attention in the Ukrainian 
society with certain cases being widely discussed 
"in the mass media. However, the quality of this "
information has significant gaps in terms of reliability and representativeness; use of anecdotal evidence 
could lead to “mythologizing” selected episodes 
and distorting the general picture. In times of armed 
"conflict, information on GBV can be also used as "
means to manipulate public attitudes or even as 
propaganda – a direct instrument of the information 
"war. As monitoring of the mass media revealed, news "
reports paid more attention to highlighting which 
party to the conflict perpetrated the acts rather than 
focusing on the prevention policies or practice of 
bringing those liable to justice. 
4. Sociological surveys remain reliable sources of 
"information, as data aggregation through statistical "
"procedures provides depersonalization of all findings, "
while the method of individual interviews allows for 
establishing a rapport with respondents and gives 
"the opportunity to clarify specific points. However, "
GBV surveys are challenging with regard to the high 
sensitivity of the topic and possible stigmatization 
of survivors in the community. In the conditions of 
"an on-going conflict, such surveys require increased "
"attention to safety of all participants, ethical "
standards and confidentiality. That is why the survey 
was conducted by specially trained interviewers. 
In order to raise the population’s awareness of the 
"services available for GBV survivors, information on "
these services was updated and generalized in all 
regions covered by the study. The survey tools were 
developed in accordance with the approaches of 
the Gender-based Violence Tools Manual in Conflict-
Affected Settings adjusted to Ukraine’s social and 
cultural context with the involvement of a broad 
range of national and international experts. The 
survey topics were focused on the experience of 
various forms of violence outside the family during 
"the conflict (and during displacement for IDPs), "
partner violence and the general public’s attitudes to 
"this problem, the practice of survivors seeking help "
and their coping strategies in cases of GBV. During 
"the fieldwork, interviews were conducted with 1,505 "
"women from the conflict-affected regions, and 1,007 "
displaced women staying in host communities there. 
7 6
UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINE5. The survey confirmed the increased vulnerability 
to various forms of violence in the conflict setting 
– the share of IDP women reporting at least one 
instance of violence outside the family before their 
displacement was three times higher than that 
of local women during the entire conflict (15.2% 
against 5.3% of respondents). The survey program 
"suggested a study of various types of psychological, "
"economic, physical and sexual violence. Among the "
"most prevalent forms of abuse during the conflict, "
both groups of respondents reported instances of 
"humiliation, insults, intimidation, blackmail, verbal "
"threats, physical violence (being hit or slapped), "
"confiscation of  money or property, confiscation "
"of official documents, forced labour without pay "
"or for a pittance, and being subjected to improper "
sexual comments. In spite of the wide-spread taboo 
"towards sexual violence, some episodes were also "
documented during the survey.
6. The conflict’s impact on GBV risks is also seen 
through the generalization of circumstances of the 
"most serious episodes of violence. In particular, "
violent situations survived by women in local 
communities reflected a snapshot of the everyday 
life of the Ukrainian society: most episodes were 
caused by one perpetrator whom the victim knew 
personally; they were alone at the time and did 
not face any particular threat to personal safety. In 
"contrast, the prevailing numbers of IDP survivors "
have encountered violent situations caused by 
groups of people that the survivors did not know 
personally; they faced direct threats to their lives 
"at the time of the incident, and confirmed that "
witnesses were also in danger. The checkpoints at 
the demarcation line were regarded among the most 
dangerous locations in terms of vulnerability to all 
forms of violence.
7. The experience of violence is not just reflected in 
physical health (although the survivors of violence 
"during the conflict mostly mentioned minor injuries, "
"there were serious traumas reported, as well as "
sexually transmitted diseases and exacerbations 
of other diseases); it could also result in important 
"psychological consequences, including life-long "
"effects for the victim. As a result of displacement, "
"the deprivation from normal life, these psychological "
effects are much more intense among IDPs. The most 
prevalent disorders included intrusive memories 
"(flashbacks), significant changes in sleep patterns "
"and repeated nightmares, and a permanent feeling "
of fear or guilt. These problems could adversely 
"influence resistibility to conflict among IDPs, "
potentially provoking the risk of increased domestic 
violence and violence outside the family. This is why the need for accessible services of psychological 
support is acute not only for the reported survivors 
"of violence, but also for the broader contingents of "
IDPs.  
"8. According to the survey results, there is no common "
practice to seek assistance from specialized 
institutions in cases of violence. The overwhelming 
numbers of survivors have not applied for 
"psychological or legal support, neither have they "
applied for medical assistance. The main causes for 
not applying for assistance according to respondents 
"were unawareness of the availability of services, "
absence of proper institutions in communities 
and mistrust in service personnel. One in ten IDP 
survivors hadn’t sought the assistance of law 
enforcement bodies because of the fear of further 
"violence. As a whole, survivors of violence usually "
share their experience with those they are the 
closest to (such as family members and friends). 
The emotional support provided by friends and 
loved ones is regarded as the most effective coping 
strategy in cases of violence. Some expectations 
of help were expressed for the assistance of 
psychologists and representatives of NGOs and 
women’s support groups.
9. One of the survey components was focused on 
partner violence in terms of the personal experience 
of respondents and the general public’s attitudes to 
this problem. The focus group discussions revealed 
"that in many minds, there is a clear distinction "
between those forms of violence that may occur in 
the family and sexual violence that happens in the 
outside society. The attitudes to these problems 
differ in terms of the perception of criminal liability 
and the severity of the offence. While the facts of 
sexual abuse cause a criminalisation of the attacker 
"among community members, domestic violence "
is primarily considered a usual phenomenon that 
should not attract a lot of attention. Though women 
do not justify physical violence and controlling 
"behaviour in marriage, they accept the assistance of "
outsiders in spousal conflicts only in extreme cases 
which if unchecked may lead to severe injury. 
10. The survey not only confirmed the sustainable 
stereotypical attitudes to gender roles within a 
Ukrainian family; it also provided grounds to argue 
for the strengthening of such stereotypes during 
the time of military conflict and humanitarian 
crisis. Despite the fact that there is a subjective 
assessment of an increased amount of conflicts 
"within the society and in the family, the survey has "
not revealed any significant influence of the military 
conflict in Donbas on partner violence (7.9% of IDPs 
7 6
UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINEand 7.5% of local women reported that they faced 
"intimate partner violence (IPV) before the conflict, "
while the corresponding reported rates were 6.9% 
and 8.2% during the last 12 months). Some decrease 
in the IPV rates among displaced persons may be 
"explained by women’s transition to more traditional, "
patriarchal models of marital relations in front of the 
new challenges of survival at the time of a deep crisis. 
"As focus group discussions revealed, the “value” of "
men as breadwinners is increasing because of the 
large-scale mobilization of men to the army; this may 
influence female perceptions of domestic violence and 
identification of its particular forms. 
11. Experience of IPV is leading to significant health 
issues among survivors (12% of married women 
confirmed some sort of physical injury perpetrated 
"by their husband/partners), including issues of "
"reproductive health. At the same time, public "
disapproval of applying for specialized assistance 
in cases of domestic violence and the prevalent 
stigmatizing of survivors in communities inhibits 
the efficiency of any support. Population awareness 
on available services for GBV survivors and specific 
service providers remains low; there is no proper 
planning of safety strategies – almost a half of IPV 
survivors do not know how to deal with a repeat 
"situation. Thus, there is a need for awareness raising "
"campaigns, targeted at disseminating information on "
safety planning and coping strategies for IPV.
12. The systematic character of problems that restrain 
the efficiency of public policies on GBV prevention 
was acknowledged by in-depth interviews with 
regional experts from various institutional sectors. 
The new challenges related to the military conflict 
and appearance of IDPs have just lead to a further 
aggravation of the existing gaps. Among the basic 
institutional failings are poorly established systems 
of coordination of activities and cooperation among 
"experts, absence of regular information exchange and "
"a single database of GBV cases, lack of skilled experts "
"in the field of GBV and retention of such experts, the "
residual principle of funding for respective activities. 
The provision of timely and efficient support to GBV 
survivors is restrained by a lack of 24-hour hot lines 
"at the regional level, absence of any emergency "
"psychological support in local communities, lack of "
"shelters for survivors of domestic violence, scarce "
correctional programs for abusers and the absence 
of compulsive instruments to make them attend 
these programs. The prevalence of GBV in the 
society roots also in the insufficient consideration of 
"gender concepts in the education system, and in the "
underdeveloped system of comprehensive training of 
young people to prepare them for adulthood..13. The assessment of the needs in improving GBV 
policies provided grounds for recommendations 
on institutional policy reforms (full adjustment of 
Ukraine’s legislation on GBV issues into compliance 
"with international standards, strengthening penalties "
for abusers and ensuring the abuser’s isolation from 
"survivors of domestic violence, including a system of "
"protection orders), capacity building of multi-sectoral "
service providers (improving functional coordination 
"among participating bodies, creation of a single "
interdepartmental database on GBV cases that would 
enable providing timely referrals to proper services 
"for survivors, training of skilled experts in all fields "
"of GBV response, in particular crisis psychologists), "
improving the system of support of GBV survivors 
(expansion of the network of providers of social 
"and psychological services, development of "
emergency psychological services and ensuring their 
"accessibility at the local level, creation of shelters "
"for survivors of domestic violence, state support "
"of NGOs and CSOs involved in GBV response, "
"implementation of corrective programs for abusers), "
and expansion of information campaigns for those 
at risk of GBV through awareness raising programs 
"(safety planning, support of the 24-hour hot lines at "
"the regional level, fostering the practice of applying "
for psychological and social support) and educative 
work with disadvantaged families and vulnerable 
population groups. The target group of social and 
psychological support should include families of 
demobilized military personnel returning to their 
families after participating in the ATO. In light of the 
"on-going military conflict, particular attention should "
be paid to the prevention of any form of violence 
"against the civil population, as well as biased "
"attitudes towards internally displaced people, and "
the support of their comprehensive integration into 
hosting communities .

UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINEINTRODUCTION
It is acknowledged that risks of GBV 
increase in conditions of military 
conflict and humanitarian crisis. 
Degradation and ruination of the 
community level public service 
"system, the lack of law enforcement, "
limited access to health facilities and 
providers of social and psychological 
support result in an increased 
vulnerability of violence survivors in 
times of armed conflict. The scales 
of domestic violence can increase 
"in these circumstances, while the "
spread of poverty and deprivations 
of a normal lifestyle pave the way for 
"new forms of GBV, such as human "
trafficking or forced prostitution. 
The political destabilization and start 
of the military conflict in eastern 
Ukraine in 2014 were accompanied 
by numerous cases of human rights 
"violations, including evidence of "
gender-based violence in the regions 
affected by military operations. 
The creation of large-scale flows 
of internally displaced persons 
(IDPs) resulted in new humanitarian 
challenges related to the need to 
provide social support to numerous 
contingents of people forced to leave 
"their homes due to armed conflict, to "
adapt them to new conditions of life 
and to integrate them into the society.
"In these crisis conditions, some "
international organizations initiated 
situational analyses and assessments 
of humanitarian needs of the 
"population, and provided an adequate "
response to the new challenges 
through the development of targeted 
"strategies of support. However, in spite "
of a common acknowledgment of the 
"high risks of GBV during the conflict, "
most of these assessments did not 
provide a deep analysis of GBV 
prevalence in the conflict-affected 
"regions. Respectively, the lack of "
reliable information on the extent and 
manifestations of GBV restrained the development of effective measures 
of policy response at the national and 
community levels. 
"In summer of 2015, using the support "
of international donors and its own 
"funds, UNFPA launched a situational "
analysis on the prevalence and 
features of GBV in the conflict setting. 
The tasks of the study were focused 
on the collecting and aggregation 
of reliable information on GBV rates 
in the conflict-affected regions 
(Terms of Reference are presented 
in Annex A). The methodological 
grounds of the study were based 
on basic international standards 
and recommendations for GBV 
assessment in conflict settings1 
adjusted to Ukraine’s socio-cultural 
context with the involvement of a wide 
range of national and international 
experts. The study comprised a desk 
review of available publications and 
"legislation related to GBV, a sample "
survey among permanent residents 
"and IDPs, focus group discussions "
to enrich and refine the survey 
"findings, and also key informant "
interviews to better understand 
the design and performance of 
the national GBV prevention and 
response machinery. The study tools 
development was coordinated by the 
leading developer of international 
methodology to ensure compliance 
with international technical and ethical 
"standards; to validate the results, an "
international consultant was involved 
in the interpretation of data and the 
preparation of the analytical report. 
The study was conducted by experts 
of the Ukrainian Centre for Social 
Reforms in the government-controlled 
areas of Donetsk and Lugansk 
"oblasts, and in Dnipropetrovsk, "
Zaporizhzhya and Kharkiv oblasts 
hosting the main inflow of IDPs. The 
fieldwork was implemented by the 
permanent network of interviewers Gender-based violence 
(GBV) is regarded among 
the most common human 
"rights violations, occurring "
all over the world. According 
"to empirical evidence, "
GBV disproportionately 
affects women because of 
the unequal distribution 
of powers and resources 
between women and 
"men, women’s economic "
vulnerability and their 
dependent position in the 
family. Women and girls are 
not only facing high risks of 
"GBV, but suffer from a lack "
of capacity and resources 
needed to prevent or 
"avoid situations of GBV, to "
seek justice and support. 
They are also particularly 
vulnerable to the negative 
"effects of violence, including "
"unwanted pregnancy, unsafe "
abortions and the issues 
"of reproductive health, the "
risk of sexually transmitted 
diseases and HIV infection. 
Psychological stress and 
attributes of post-traumatic 
syndrome can lead to long-
term negative consequences 
that affect all dimensions of 
women’s lives.

UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINEof the sociological agency “Centre 
for Social Monitoring” in September 
and October of 2015. To assess 
respondents’ personal experience of 
GBV and to estimate and compare 
their vulnerability to manifestations 
"of violence during the conflict, "
two target groups of respondents 
were selected: women among IDPs 
and women among permanent 
population of the regions. The survey 
was conducted by specially trained 
interviewers in accordance with 
all technical standards and ethical 
considerations of similar surveys; to 
raise population awareness of GBV 
"and provide referrals in cases of need, "
relevant information on the available 
services for GBV survivors was 
updated in all regions covered by the 
survey.  
To clarify and refine certain findings 
"of the study, 10 focus group "
discussions with local community 
members were conducted in all 
regions; the discussion topics 
covered general attitude to GBV in 
"the society, understanding its forms "
"and dimensions, assessment of the "
possible impact of the military conflict 
in Donetsk and Lugansk regions on 
domestic violence and GBV outside 
"the family, justification of the need "
for services for survivors at the 
"community level, public opinion on "
the effective instruments to combat 
gender-based violence.
"In all regions covered by the study, "
situational analysis was conducted 
based on in-depth interviews with 
experts in the field of GBV response 
representing various institutional 
"sectors - local authorities and CSOs, "
law enforcement agencies and 
"providers of social services, medical "
institutions and the legal aid sector.
The results of the study translated 
into a range of recommendations and proposals for further development 
of policies on GBV which can be 
applied at different levels of decision-
making by representatives of various 
sectors and institutions of civil society 
involved in GBV response.  SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES 
OF THE STUDY 
INCLUDED:
•	collection and generalization 
of official data of 
administrative statistics 
regarding GBV prevalence in 
five regions covered by the 
study;

relevant information in the 
mass media and information 
environment;
•	GBV prevalence survey in 
"the conflict-affected regions, "
analysis of GBV forms and 
"dimensions, determination "
of the risk factors and

IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINE1.1. ADMINISTRATIVE DATA ON GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE 
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS: THE RECENT TRENDS 
AND DATA GAPS
As a result of political destabilization 
in Ukraine and development of the 
military conflict in Donetsk and Lugansk 
"regions, a new type of migrant has "
emerged caused by appearance 
of the internally displaced people 
"(IDPs) in Ukraine. Presently, the "
registration of IDPs is provided by the 
Interdepartmental Coordination Staff 
(ICS) and the Ministry of Social Policy 
of Ukraine. The ICS registers those 
persons who have applied for assistance 
in re-settlement and displacement; 
the relevant information is collected 
in the register of citizens of Ukraine 
displaced from the NGCAs and ATO-
affected areas. The MoSP registers 
individuals who have applied for 
pensions and social allowances at their 
"new places of residence. In reality, the "
MoSP registration system captures not 
"only the displaced persons, but also "
those who actually live in the NGCAs 
but periodically visit the government 
controlled areas (GCAs) to collect their 
pensions or social allowances (the 
phenomenon is called “pension tourism” 
"by experts). Therefore, the ICS data on "
IDP movements can be regarded as 
more accurate for any research purpose.
According to the operative information 
"of the ICS, the total number of internally displaced people was 970.1 "
thousand persons as of 29 October 
"20153. Moreover, about several hundred "
thousand IDPs are still non-registered 
due to various reasons. Among the 
"registered IDPs, 21.3 thousand people "
have moved from the Autonomous 
"Republic of Crimea, while 948.8 "
thousand people (almost 98% of their 
total number) fled the areas covered 
by the ATO. The largest numbers of 
displaced people are situated in the 
"regions covered by the study program, "
including GCAs of Lugansk oblast 
"(230.9 thousand people), Kharkiv oblast "
"(198.0 thousand people), GCAs of "
"Donetsk oblast (110.0 thousand people), "
Dnipropetrovsk oblast (85.4 thousand 
people) and Zaporizhzhya oblast (66.5 
"thousand people). In total, more than "
70% of the total number of IDPs are 
placed in these 5 regions (Fig. 1.1). 
"Some studies, in particular the survey "
of the Scientific Research Institute 
of Social and Judicial Psychiatry and 
Narcology of the Ministry of Health of 
"Ukraine, reveal that at least some IDPs "
will try to settle in their current transit 
region and will not try to return home 
after the completion of the ATO. As a 
"result, important transformations of "
population’s territorial distribution will 
take place in Ukraine.The conflict-affected 
regions covered by the 
"study (Dnipropetrovsk, "
"Donetsk, Kharkiv, "
Lugansk and 
Zaporizhzhya regions or 
oblasts) have been the 
most populated regions 
of Ukraine. As of early 
"20142, Donetsk and "
Dnipropetrovsk oblasts 
were at the first and the 
second positions among 
27 regions of Ukraine 
by the total population 
"number, while residents "
of the five oblasts 
altogether made almost 
one-third of the total

IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINECRIME LEVELS IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED 
REGIONS: STATISTICAL ASSESSMENT.
The conflict-affected regions have been characterized by 
significantly higher crime rates than the average Ukrainian 
indicators prior to the conflict in Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts 
"(Fig. 1.2). An exception was made by Kharkiv oblast, as its "
regional crime rate has approached the all-Ukrainian rate 
"since mid-2000’s. Regarding the crime rate (the number of criminal offences registered per year per 100,000 population), "
"Zaporizhzhya, Lugansk and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts occupied "
the top three positions among all regions of Ukraine in 
"2005, while Donetsk oblast shared the fourth position with "
"the city of Sebastopol. In 2010, these four oblasts were also "
among Ukraine’s 6 highest crime rate areas.
"Until 2013, the registration of criminal offences was done "
"by the Ministry of Interior (MoI) of Ukraine, with all types of "
"criminal offences being registered. In 2012, radical changes "
took place in the system of registration of criminal offences 
related to the adoption of the new Criminal Procedural Code 
of Ukraine on 13 April 20124. Due to changes in the registration 
"methodology, crime indicators for 2013-2015 are not "
comparable with the data from previous periods. According to 
"para. 22 of the Transitional Provisions of the Code, the Single "
Register of Prejudicial Investigations had to be created (SRPI)5. 
The Prosecutor General’s Office is defined as a holder of the 
Single Register of Prejudicial Investigations; since 20 November 
"2012, the Prosecutor General’s Office (PGO) is also authorized "
to collect and maintain all crime statistics. 
"According to the Provisions, the SRPI is providing the unified "
audit of all criminal offences and decisions made as a result 
of prejudicial investigations; crime offenders and results of 
criminal proceeding; operative control over law violations 
at time of prejudicial investigation; analysis of the status 
and structure of criminal offences in the country. Data on 
crime offences are provided in the Single Register on Crime 
"Offences, the corresponding statistics reporting Form №1 "
(monthly) was approved by the Decree of Prosecutor General’s 
Office of 23 October 2012 № 100 by agreement with the State 
Statistics Service of Ukraine. The unified reporting on crime 
"offences, offenders and criminal proceedings is formed by the "
"Prosecutor General’s Office, Prosecutor’s Offices in oblasts of "
Ukraine and in Kyiv city based on the information on crime 
offences and results of prejudicial investigations. The number 
of registered crime offences by types of offences is fixed 
"during the reporting period, as well as information about law "
"enforcement bodies that registered the offences, information "
"on victims of offences and material damage, compensations and withdrawals of crime objects. Statistical data are "
"summarized monthly, with gradual accumulation during a "
year. The total number of registered crime offences does not 
include crimes with criminal proceeding closed due to certain 
legitimate reasons specified in respective laws of Ukraine.
"As a result, a situation is possible where the number of crime "
offences registered during the month of reporting is smaller 
than the number of crimes during the preceding month. It can 
be possible in cases where the number of crime offences with 
closed proceedings exceeds the number of newly registered 
"crimes during the same month. That is why, unfortunately, "
the analysis of monthly dynamics of crime offences does not 
"provide reliable data, and any dynamic changes can be traced "
only based on annual statistics or through period-to-period 
comparisons between the years.  
"According to the Prosecutor General’s Office, four out of five "
conflict-affected regions have been still characterized by 
notably higher crime rates (based on the new methodology 
of registration) than Ukraine’s averages in 2013-2014. As for 
"Kharkiv oblast, its crime rate was also significantly higher "
"than the average Ukrainian rate in 2013, but it has dropped "
below the average indicator in 2014 (Fig. 1.3). The available 
data also reveal a decline in the intensity of criminal offences 
"in Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts. But, it obviously results from "
underreporting of criminal offences by central authorities at 
"the NGCAs of these regions. Moreover, statistical estimation "
of crime rates largely depends on the gaps in the assessment 
of the total population numbers. The real numbers of current 
population in Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts are smaller than 
"those reported by the State Statistics Service; respectively, the "
officially reported crime rates are underestimated.

UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINEThe share of women is particularly large 
"among survivors of rapes, crimes related to "
"human trafficking and domestic violence, "
and victims of robberies (Table 1.3). Though 
Ukrainian experts argue about a recent 
increase in the number of men surviving 
"human trafficking, the statistics of the "
Prosecutor General’s Office reveal that 
women suffered from such crimes 5-13 times 
more often than men in the conflict-affected 
regions. It is also notable that the share of 
women who have experienced theft (which 
is rather related to psychological violence) is 
significantly larger than the share of women 
who have survived robberies (rather physical 
violence).
"In total, the share of women among survivors "
of crime offences is higher in the conflict-
affected regions as compared with Ukraine’s 
"averages (Annex B, Tables B8-B10). It "
particularly concerns the sex structure of 
"survivors of human trafficking, theft and fraud. However, the share of women among victims "
of crime is currently decreasing; it could result 
from partial non-reporting of crime offences 
by women due to various reasons.
The share of women among victims of 
"crime in 2014 was higher in Dnipropetrovsk, "
Zaporizhzhya and Kharkiv oblasts as 
compared with Donetsk and Lugansk 
"oblasts, although the opposite trends were "
"observed in 2013. In other words, an increase "
in violence against women is observed in the 
regions bordering the areas of the ATO. In 
"total, women who have survived any criminal "
offense in the conflict-affected regions made 
38.3% of the total number of female survivors 
of crimes in Ukraine during the period from 
the beginning of 2013 to midyear 2015. This 
share is notably larger than the share of 
the conflict-affected regions in the total 
number of population of Ukraine and in the 
"total female population, given the general "
"demographics of the country.IN TOTAL, WOMEN "

"Thus, the conflict-affected regions can be regarded as areas "
"with traditionally high crime rates, while the military conflict "
in Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts and related IDP flows 
and increased numbers of military personnel have led to a 
further aggravation of the crime situation in these regions. 
The registered indicators of crimes are largely influenced 
by statistical gaps related to both counting the number 
of criminal offences and verifying the real total population 
"numbers; therefore, a reliable analysis of the recent trends "
"in crime rates is very complicated. Also, it has to be "
acknowledged that the administrative data on GBV rates 
"do not reflect the actual prevalence of this phenomenon among the population, as they are based exclusively on "
the reported numbers of appeals and cases of registered 
offenses. Administrative statistics describe only the “tip of 
"the iceberg”, as only a very small share of survivors apply "
for assistance – due to social and cultural barriers and 
because of drawbacks of legal and institutional support 
"systems. Therefore, a further study of GBV prevalence in "
the conflict-affected regions was conducted  based on 
"multiple data sources, including the analysis of secondary "
"data, i.e. coverage of similar cases in the mass media and "
information space and summarizing the results of other

UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINE1.2. COVERAGE OF THE PROBLEM OF GENDER-BASED 
VIOLENCE IN THE MASS-MEDIA AND INFORMATION 
ENVIRONMENT: ANAL YSIS OF SECONDARY DATA
Analysis of secondary data is a valid 
option for collecting and processing 
"information, especially if the research "
issue causes significant public 
response.
Among available data sources suitable 
for a desk study are official reports 
"of government agencies, thematic "
"research reports, special monitoring "
reports of international and national 
"human rights organizations, reports of "
"NGOs and public associations, mass "
"media publications, newsfeeds and "
"so on. Obviously, these data sources "
are characterized by some important 
gaps: e.g. they are fragmented since 
focusing on individual cases does not 
provide a comprehensive picture of 
the phenomenon and does not allow 
for an assessment of its prevalence. 
"However, the advantage of this "
method is seen in the opportunity 
"for an in-depth analysis, assessment "
of public attitudes to the subject 
of study through comments in the 
"media space. At the same time, this "
information is usually emotionally 
"expressed, thus attracting the "
attention of the public. To this 
"end, emotional, vivid mass media "
publications could also be a good 
channel for sharing the study results.
The problem of violence in the 
conflict area and adjacent regions 
remains one of the most common 
topics discussed in the society 
"recently. However, despite the rapid "
dissemination of information on 
such cases in the media space and 
significant response of the civil 
"society, the quality of information is "
often hampered by a number of gaps 
in accuracy and representativeness. In 
contrast to the constraints of formal 
"administrative data-based  statistics, "
analysis of secondary data on GBV can be complicated by the trend of 
"mythologizing individual cases, where "
common gossip talks tend to reveal 
new sensational details over again and 
magnify the case.
"In the on-going military confrontation, "
information on the facts of gender-
based violence can be used as 
means of manipulating public 
opinion or even as instruments of the 
"information war. As Olha Vesnyanka, "
researcher of the “Respect” 
"organization argues, the theme "
of sexual violence is sometimes 
used as instrument of propaganda 
nowadays: “In social networks 
"and news sites, it looks very "
often like such information 
is purposefully given in a 
way to make the society 
hate the simulated enemy”6.
"Thus, media monitoring revealed "
that such news reports paid more 
attention to which side in the military 
conflict the abusers belonged 
instead of focusing on preventing 
similar situations or the prosecution 
"of offenders. Therefore, a critical "
analysis of secondary data from 
various sources and separating facts 
from rumours is very important 
"when studying any social problem, in "
particular such sensitive as gender-
based violence. 
A stable feature of the last decade 
has been seen in Ukrainians’ 
distrust towards official sources of 
"information7. However, international "
observers are generally trusted by 
the public. International monitoring 
missions emphasize the increased 
prevalence of GBV in the regions 
affected by military operations. In 
"particular, there was a statement at the meeting of the UN Security "
"Council declaring that, along with "
"other criminal offences, there are "
many rapes of women in the Donbas 
"area. “There are facts of mass crimes, "
"detentions, abductions, torture, "
intimidation. According to the latest 
"information of monitoring groups, "
there is violence against women 
"– a lot of rapes”, as mentioned by "
"Raimonda Murmokaite8, Representative "
of Lithuania to the United Nations. 
The resolution clearly identified the 
problem expressing the concern of 
the UN: “There is information about 
cases of sexual violence and gender-
"based violence, including rapes and "
"murders, tortures and abuse of women, "
committed by armed groups in the 
self-proclaimed “Donetsk People’s 
Republic” and “Lugansk People’s 
Republic”; reports on cases of violence 
"and discrimination against women, "
as well as allegations of reprisals 
against women’s rights activists in 
"the territory of Crimea, which is the "
de facto subordinated to the Russian 
Federation; mass violation of rights of 
the refugee women in the territory of 
the Russian Federation“.
International experts emphasize that 
the concealment of cases of sexual 
violence in the NGCAs is wide-
spread. According to the report of the 
monitoring mission by the Ukrainian 
Helsinki Human Rights Union entitled 
“Problems of gender-based violence 
"in the conflict area”, the conclusions "
are made that cases of human rights 
violations and violence exist in 
"these areas, but it is highlighted that "
survivors are not ready to talk about 
these facts. The report states that:
"•	simulating threats and violence, "
"including sexual violence, is not "
"perceived as violence, although "
6 http:/ /povaha.org.ua/pro-sajt/
"7 According to the study of the Fund ""Democratic initiatives"" and the Razumkov Centre in the second half of July 2015, volunteers are the leaders of public trust - 67% "
Ukrainians trust them completely or partially. This is the highest trust rate among all public and social institutions in Ukraine. Among other leaders of trust: church (62% 
"of respondents), Armed Force of Ukraine (55%), volunteer battalions (53%) and civil society organizations (46%). 47% of respondents trust to the Ukrainian mass media, "
"but almost the same percent of respondents don’t trust to the mass media. The very low rates of trust is expressed to prosecutors (13% of respondents), courts (13%), "
"Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine (15%), police (18%) and Government (18%). Correspondingly, these institutions have the proportional impact on a society in the context of "
public perceptions.

UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINEit is causing deep wounds to 
survivors and is hard to overcome 
in the long-term;
•	there are no grounds to argue 
that there were mass rapes 
used as means of war during 
"the temporary occupation, "
unlike some other conflict zones 
"(Rwanda, Bosnia etc.);"
•	there is indirect evidence 
"that human rights violations, "
"violence, and particularly sexual "
abuse in the non-government 
"controlled areas are more cruel, "
occur frequently and are not 
documented.
The experts of the Helsinki Union 
together with the “Women’s 
Information Consultative Centre” 
collected data on gender-based 
violence in the conflict area to 
analyze the situation and develop 
recommendations for responsible 
institutions and to protect the 
"survivors. Thus, one of the respondents "
told the mission about the complicated 
epidemiological situation in the 
occupied territories. According 
"to her, female physicians from a "
dermatovenerology clinic had to 
conceal the real diagnoses [of sexually 
transmitted infections] from their 
“local militia” patients because they 
feared reprisal:
“Every second one of 
"them has AIDS, this is the "
epidemic and no jokes. 
Syphilis is transmitted 
through domestic contacts. 
"Venerologists carry gauze, "
they photograph the place 
"where he sat down, stood "
up etc. A doctor revealed 
"a disease in him, but it is "
impossible to find him. Then 
he came again saying that 
it hurt more. She says she 
could not tell him that he’s 
got AIDS because he would 
shoot her; and so she was 
silent or said something 
else. The infected man 
"walks free with the disease and spreads it. Eventually, "
this epidemic will pass on 
to the peaceful areas. They 
ride freely throughout 
the territory of “Donetsk 
People’s Republic” to the 
government-controlled 
areas”  
- told a woman in Kramatorsk.
The national information space 
circulates lots of references to the 
facts of women becoming “small 
coins” used by different criminal gangs 
to settle the scores in the occupied 
"territories. Thus, a daughter of the local "
“ataman” (gang leader) was kidnapped 
as ordered by the leadership of the 
so-called “Lugansk People’s Republic”; 
"she was raped and severely beaten, "
and dumped on the roadside. The girl 
was later put into the intensive care 
unit of the local hospital9.
The content analysis of the media 
reveals different attitudes to the 
facts related to rapes and criminal 
abusers in the different cities of 
the NGCAs. While in some cities 
such cases are not hushed up and 
"investigated, survivors are threatened "
in the case of disclosure; there are 
public punishments for abusers in 
"others settlements. In particular, there "
was information on the internet that 
a “local commandant of Lugansk 
People’s Republic” in Alchevsk raped a 
22-year-old girl that he had to protect. 
"As a punishment, his “comrades” gave "
him a plaque with the inscription “I am 
a rapist” and he had to hold it whilst 
walking around the city. The process of 
punishment was that photographs and 
videos of him holding the plaque were 
later posted on the internet.
The ban on women from visiting 
cafes and other entertainment venues 
in Lugansk can also be regarded 
as a manifestation of gender-
based violence. The initiator of this 
“innovation” believed that women 
should be “mothers and homemakers 
"and sit at home, doing embroidery, "
baking pies and celebrate the 8th of 
March”10. Later a video was posted 
on the internet showing the public 
flogging for visiting cafes of a women named Natalia.
"Obviously, in order to talk about the "
"facts of violence, the evidence base "
"should be available. Lisa Rai, Director "
of the Department of Communications 
of the International Women’s Rights 
Centre “La Strada Ukraine” noted: 
‘since there are no police in 
"the NGCAs, it is impossible "
to document evidence of 
cases of sexual violence. 
We asked this question 
to the law enforcement 
"agencies, but they just "
shrugged because nothing 
can be done11“. According to L. 
"Rai, there have been about a hundred "
calls to the “La Strada Ukraine” help 
hotline caused by spousal quarrels and 
misunderstandings due to different 
views of the political situation in the 
"country. Typically, the suffering party "
was women. If they tried to leave with 
a child to go to GCAs and the husband 
"or his family found out, they would be "
prevented from leaving. 
"However, the information about "
"crimes, especially those committed "
"by people in uniform, is spreading in "
the government controlled areas of 
"Ukraine, and increasing in dramatic "
detail. It can be partly explained by 
the situation where a significant share 
of the population of the region does 
not support the current government 
and the presence of military personnel 
in the eastern regions. In October-
"November of 2014, there were rumors "
about an extremely violent mass 
rape of women by Ukrainian military 
personnel in Mariupol city. Ordinary 
citizens telephoned reporters and 
reported seemingly reliable facts about 
victims in hospitals or intensive care 
units. In order to find out whether 
"these facts were true, journalists did "
an investigation. The results were 
published on the official website of the 
city of Mariupol.
"“Then, in early October, the "
phone rang in our editorial 
office. A woman was calling. 
She said that there is a 
girl in the intensive care

FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINEunit of city hospital №2 who 
has been brutally raped 
by the Ukrainian military. 
"‘she was just broken, she "
"is unconscious now, and "
doctors are fighting for her 
"life,” - lamented the woman. "
We contacted the intensive 
"care unit immediately, and "
my questions have surprised 
doctors there. “We do not 
have any rape victims” - was 
the short answer”12.
"At first, they were talking about 10 "
"survivors, then about 80 survivors, "
while the journalists were “absolutely 
reliably” told that the number of 
Mariupol’s victims of the military’s 
violence exceeded 80 women in the 
"end of October, while the police was "
not disclosing the actual number of 
crimes and protected the offenders. 
The journalists decided to verify all 
facts and visited all hospitals in the city 
where survivors of sexual violence could 
stay. No women treated after rape were 
found at the local hospitals. Not trusting 
"official information, the journalists "
"interviewed hospital patients, but the "
result was the same.
The press service of Mariupol City 
Department of Police informed  the reporters that there were six 
documented cases of rape of women 
"since the beginning of the year, but no "
military personnel were involved in the 
"criminal cases. The abusers, detained "
"for committing these crimes, included "
former convicts recently released from 
"prison. In one case, the rape was linked "
to the theft of property; an attacker 
"would first rob a woman, but changed "
his plans during the fight. According to 
"the press service of the Interior Ministry, "
two 30-year-old men attacked a shop 
assistant who returned home late at 
night. They took away her bag and gold 
"jewellery, but that was not enough. They "
"raped the woman in the street, and then "
led her to the apartment of one of the 
attackers. They photographed parts 
of the attack using a camera phone so 
they could intimidate and blackmail their 
victim thus preventing her from seeking 
assistance from the police13.
"In spite of the lack of “mass” facts, there "
are single cases of rape by the military 
personnel filed in the conflict-affected 
"regions. In June of 2015, the police "
arrested a 40-year-old soldier of the 
"Armed Forces of Ukraine in Kurakhovo, "
Donetsk oblast. He was suspected of 
raping a 16-year old girl14.
“A 16-year-old girl applied to 
the department of Maryino 
police station. She said that an unknown man raped her. 
Police detained the rapist ... 
It was established that the 
attacker was military”
"– Natalia Schyman, the chief of the press "
service of Donetsk oblast police.
– “The injured girl said that 
she’d met that man the 
night before. She was with 
a friend when he invited her 
for a walk. They went to the 
recreation center Dubrava 
where it all happened. 
"In the morning, she told "
police.” 
"Upon request, the police initiated a "
criminal proceeding in accordance with 
Article 152 Part 3 of the CPC of Ukraine. 
The rapist could be sentenced to 7 to 
12 years in prison.
A separate group at risk during the 
time of conflict was female volunteers 
who faced the most ill-treatment 
"during detention by armed gangs, "
because they were treated as direct 
participants of armed confrontation. 
Below are the stories of two women. 
These women were detained after 
being arrested at checkpoints because 
someone alleged they carried food for 
the Ukrainian military.  
"“I was pulled by the hair out of the car, snatching almost all of it. Pulled along the ground by hair. "
Beaten during the arrest. Daily death threats. Threatened with rape and mockery. Threatened to 
"leave that place as pieces in plastic bags""  "
"– a woman, Kramatorsk  "
“I was taken at the checkpoint between Kramatorsk and Slaviansk. We tried to escape but were 
caught by boards with nails thrown under the wheels. Blocked by a white van and another 2 
"cars. Dressed in plastic handcuffs, thrown on the ground face down, beaten on the back with a "
rifle butt. I was lucky being beaten by a man with a weapon because I was beaten with a butt. 
The other men had no weapons so they beat my friend with bats. She was beaten on her head 
"and ears. Kept in solitary confinement. Threatened with rape and mocked. Stripped, humiliated, "
"threatened. Those who interrogated wore masks. One of them had the eastern accent, but I do "
not know whether he was from there. There were threats – we will give you to the Chechens. They 
will do something with you. The man with the eastern accent cut my hair with a knife and threw 
"into the toilet. I was interrogated by different men. They unbuttoned my shirt - “OK, you pass”, "
"then pretended to shoot me. They told me to get up against the wall and pray. I started to pray, I "
didn’t know they were joking. Then another man came and said: “What are you doing? The brains 
"will be all over the camera, bring a sheet!” Then they left and didn’t come back”  "
"– a woman, Kramatorsk."

UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
"IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINEIn Krasnoarmiysk, the city police department received a report that the body of a 31-year-old "
woman was found with obvious signs of violent death in one of the apartments of Ivanovka village. 
"In the course of the investigation, it was found that the woman was abused by her cohabitant who "
hurt her to death1.
"In Kramatorsk, the police were called because an unconscious woman with injuries was delivered to "
"the hospital. As it turned out later, the woman received these injuries from her cohabitant for being "
"in a state of alcohol intoxication. Not to cause a family quarrel go public, the man tried to treat her "
"by himself for some time, but she lost consciousness and he had to call the ambulance. The woman "
"is in a coma. If she dies from her injuries her attacker can be imprisoned for a term of 15 years2.Regardless of the military conflict in the eastern regions, the problem of domestic violence remains important in the "
"Ukrainian society. As it is “not acceptable” to speak openly about this experience in communities, in particular - to "
"seek help from authorities, professionals and service providers, these cases only receive publicity when there are some "
particularly serious consequences.
With the expansion of the military 
"actions, the problem of domestic "
violence has become particularly 
acute. Servicemen have returned home 
with unrecognized post-traumatic 
stress disorder and have not sought 
psychological assistance. Human rights 
activists from “La Strada Ukraine” noted 
"that they recorded 7,725 complaints "
"in 2014, of them 72.2% were related to "
"domestic violence15. On average, the "
organization’s telephone hotline receives 
about 5.5 thousands of complaints 
"a year, but the number of women’s "
"appeals increased by 2,000 last year. "
"In 2015, there were almost 6,000 "
appeals only in the first half of the year. 
The human rights activists allocate a 
separate category of complaints of 
women who seek assistance because of 
their husband’s violence after returning 
from the war; analysis of this information 
will allow for an assessment of the scale 
of this phenomenon in the future.
“The problem of domestic 
violence because of the war 
is very serious. We have 
never faced such things 
"before, and the problem is "
exacerbated by the lack of 
resources and expertise. 
"Of course, the soldiers who "
have returned home suffer 
from stress and anxiety. 
And they often do not want 
to apply for psychological support. They think that 
alcohol is the best remedy. 
"Then, they begin to feel "
as if their wives do not 
understand what they have 
gone through and what had 
seen. And this psychological 
suffering is then escalated 
into physical or sexual 
violence.”
"- Olena Zubchenko, La Strada - Ukraine."
Even having avoided any wounds 
"and injuries, people are returning "
home completely different. According 
"to statistics, almost 80 percent of "
soldiers return home with the so-called 
“Donbass syndrome” which manifests 
"itself in depression, loss of interest in life, "
alcoholism and nightmares. 
"“Back home, you cannot "
get rid of your instincts that 
saved your life yesterday: 
hard rules that suspicious 
"sounds mean death, that you "
"should hide in a deep trench, "
that the world is divided 
by front lines and the best 
solution is to shoot first. The 
subconscious is shoving the 
bloody pictures all the time 
"- that cannot fit the quiet, "
peaceful life around you. Soldiers fall into depression. 
They get unsociable and 
hide from the surrounding 
world. This is very serious. 
Because these men lose their 
understanding of why we 
"live. Usually, manifestations "
of post-traumatic stress 
disorder start to occur a

UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINE2.1. SURVEY METHODOLOGY AND DESIGN
In order to obtain reliable information on GBV 
"prevalence in the conflict-affected regions, a special "
sample population survey was initiated. Such studies 
"remain reliable tools for collecting information, as the "
aggregation of data in the statistical analysis provides for 
full confidentiality of respondents and depersonalization 
of any results.The method of individual face-to-face 
interviews provides the possibility to establish direct 
"rapport between interviewer and respondent, as well as to clarify any questions in cases of any misunderstanding "
"or incorrect interpretation. However, GBV surveys are "
accompanied by a number of challenges with regard 
to the sensitive topics and possible stigmatization of 
survivors in local communities. In conditions of the on-
"going military conflict, the relevance of safety of all survey "
"participants is increasing, as well as the need to comply "
with full confidentiality and ethical standards of the 
research.
"In September-October of 2015, a "
special population-based survey on 
GBV was conducted in 5 conflict-
affected regions of Ukraine: 
"Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhya and "
"Kharkiv oblasts, as well as in the "
GCAs of Donetsk and Lugansk 
oblasts. Initially the survey was 
"designed to cover the NGCAs, but in July 2015 the de-facto authorities "
of the self-proclaimed “Donetsk 
People’s Republic” and “Lugansk 
People’s Republic” imposed a ban 
on any humanitarian or foreign 
assistance operations in the areas 
"under their control, which prevented "
access to the NGCAs for the survey 
teams and field data collection.

the gender-age composition

"IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINEAt the preparation stage, two types "
of questionnaires were  developed: 
1) for women from the general 
population sample representing 
local communities of the conflict-
affected region and 2) for women 
representing internally displaced 
persons (Annex C1). Both target 
groups of the survey were asked 
identical questions to enable 
comparative analysis of their 
assessments; the IDP respondents 
were provided with extended 
questionnaires featuring additional 
blocks of questions related to the 
periods of internal displacement and 
their return home (if applicable). 
Such approach was used to provide 
opportunities to define at which 
stage of the conflict women face 
the highest risks of violence. Time 
frames for displacement periods were 
individually specified by respondents; 
January 2014 was used as time 
marker to outline the period related 
to the conflict beginning.  The draft questionnaires were 
translated into English in order to 
get them reviewed and receive 
feedback from the “GBV Tools 
Manual” developers in terms of their 
"compliance with the methodology, "
technical standards and ethical 
considerations of similar surveys. The 
final adjustments of questionnaires 
were done during the training for 
interviewers and following the pilot 
test of questionnaires. 
The questionnaires were printed in 
Ukrainian and Russian. 
Specialized intense training was 
organized for interviewers and regional 
field supervisors at the beginning 
of September 2015. The training 
program was developed in a way 
to cover not only the issues related 
to the interviewing techniques and 
"practicing the survey tools, but also to "
raise interviewer’s awareness on the 
concepts of gender-based violence 
and ensure their non-judgemental 
attitude to women who could have 
survived GBV (Annex C2). Much 
"attention was paid during the training to respecting confidentiality, safety "
and ethical considerations of GBV 
"surveys, to developing basic skills in "
emergency psychological support to 
potential survivors and to learning 
about the existing opportunities to get 
assistance if required. 
"Finally, interviewers were provided "
with updated information on the 
available service providers for GBV 
survivors to be disseminated among 
the respondents towards the end of 
interviewing.SURVEY INSTRUMENTS

UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINEThe survey complied with all 
requirements of interviewing 
technology. Given the sensitive 
"nature of the questions, all "
respondents were informed about 
the general topics of the research 
and clarified how the results will be 
used – before the interview began. 
The respondents were guaranteed 
the opportunity to refuse to 
participate in the survey at any of 
"stage, to suspend or re-schedule "
the interview in case of interruption 
"by third parties, as well as absolute "
confidentiality of all responses.
The fieldwork was conducted by 50 
trained interviewers working with randomly selected respondents 
among the general population at 
137 routes. 47 interviewers recruited 
respondents among internally 
displaced persons through many 
and varied channels of recruitment 
"(Annex C, Table C1)."
"In total, the interviewers registered "
854 refusals from potential 
respondents among the general 
population (the response rate 
was 63.8%) and 183 refusals from 
potential respondents among IDPs 
(the response rate was 84.6%). 
The regional variations in the rates 
of respondent accessibility are 
presented in Table 2.1.1.

IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINE1. complications with establishing 
channels for recruitment of the 
first several IDP respondents in 
the settlements; the process was 
facilitated through the “snowball 
"effect” later. In some settlements, "
the search for IDPs had to be 
rearranged to coincide with the 
time of humanitarian aid delivery;
2. significant time spent to provide 
transportation of interviewers 
between multiple settlements 
of their individual routes in 
conditions of poorly organized 
transport infrastructure;3. significant time spent to establish 
rapport with a respondent 
because of sensitive topics of 
the survey and due to mistrust 
towards sociological surveys 
among the population; the 
process of interviewing required 
a lot of time due to the length 
of the questionnaires and the 
sensitive topics covered therein;
4. low sincerity of respondents: 
many interviewers observed 
that respondents didn’t want 
to divulge information about 
their sexual partner’s violence and/or any information about 
"their spouse. In particular, the "
procedure of random selection of 
respondents suggested collecting 
information about all household 
"members; but, some women "
refused to continue to speak 
with interviewers after hearing 
these questions. Interviewers 
noted particularly low sincerity 
"of IDPs (in particular, in the "
GCAs of Donetsk and Lugansk 
oblasts) and associated it with 
psychological state of these 
"respondents, their disinterest and "
total mistrust.  
At the time of primary data 
"processing, all questionnaires were "
controlled for completeness and 
logic of completion. Information 
quality and interviewing quality were 
also validated at this stage. In the 
"process of validation, responses of "
148 respondents from the general 
population and 98 IDP respondents 
were verified in 5 administrative 
territorial units (9.8% of the total 
number of respondents). Verification 
was done based on the route lists 
completed by interviewers indicating the characteristics of the interviewed 
"respondent. As validation revealed, "
all interviews were conducted in 
accordance with the instructions and 
in compliance with the requirements 
for similar population-based surveys. 
The analysis of the realized 
sample allows us to certify its 
correspondence to the estimated 
"sample, and the general "
representativeness of the received 
data for the target groups of the 
survey.
The layout of data arrays was 
developed and tested in the SPSS 
format. The coding was applied to 
"the respondents’ answers, while data "
were entered into electronic format 
in SPSS PC software. The database 
was developed with subsequent 
verification for quality over data 
entry and logic. Special interval variables were developed for selected 
questions. Based on the aggregated 
"database, the primary data analysis "
was conducted using SPSS to provide 
frequencies and percentages for the 
main variables; detailed multivariable

 OF THE SURVEY RESPONDENTS
"In line with the sample design, 1,505 "
women who represented the general 
population of the local communities 
"were interviewed, including 438 women "
"in Dnipropetrovsk oblast, 361 women in "
"Kharkiv oblast, 305 women in Donetsk "
"oblast, 236 women in Zaporizhzhya oblast "
"and 165 women in Lugansk oblast, as well "
"as 1,007 women were interviewed among "
"IDPs, including 471 women in Donetsk "
"oblast, 125 women in Dnipropetrovsk "
"oblast, 108 women in Zaporizhzhya oblast, "
109 women in Lugansk oblast and 194 
women in Kharkiv oblast. 
The majority of women (52.2% among 
the general population sample and 
66.2% among the IDP sample) were in 
their reproductive age (18-49 years). As 
a result of age-specific quotas applied 
"in accordance with the demographic structure of the population, there were "
slightly more women of older age 
groups in the realized sample of local 
community women (30.3% of them were 
"aged 60 and over), as compared with the "
realized sample of IDPs (correspondingly 
20.4%). Their recruiting for the interviews 
depended on their accessibility.
The prevailing number of women in 
both groups of respondents had tertiary 
education (71.1% of women from local 
"communities and 64.9% of IDP women), "
while about one-third of them had 
secondary education (including basic and 
complete ones). Only a few percent of 
women reported that they had primary 
education only. This closely correlated 
with the general structure of Ukraine’s 
population by the level of educational 
attainment.  The background

UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINEAlmost two thirds of the interviewed IDP 
women reported that they have moved 
"together with all family members (63.8%), "
so their families did not differ a lot from 
the population of local communities in 
terms of household composition. 
Almost 70% of the local women 
interviewed had no children under the 
age of 18 years; 22.4% of them had 1 child 
"aged 18 or below, 7.8% of respondents "
had 2 children or more. Among the 
"IDP women interviewed, the share of "
respondents living together with children 
under 18 years of age was larger – it 
was reported by almost a half of the 
respondents. The share of IDPs living with 
two and more children was also much 
larger (the maximum number of children 
reported was 10). A higher concentration 
of women with minor children among 
"IDPs looks quite natural, as fears for "
children and expectations of better 
future for them were regarded among 
the motivating factors for displacement 
during the conflict.  
"As to the marital history, 9.7% of women "
among IDPs and 11.6% of women from 
local communities reported that they 
have never been married or lived with a 
partner (see Table 2.2.1). As to the current 
"relationship status, more than a half of all "
ever-married / partnered women stated 
that they were currently married. Yet 3.6% 
of IDP respondents and 6.2% of women 
from local communities lived together 
with their partners being in a “serious” 
relationship at the time of interview. More 
than 40% of all ever-married / partnered 
respondents were not currently married / 
partnered at the time of interview.
Among those married / partnered 
"women, about three quarters of both "
groups of respondents have been married 
"once, about one-fifth twice, and only "
a few percent 3 times and more. The prevailing number of women reported 
their first marriage / serious partnership 
to happen before they were aged 25 
"(Annex C, Table C.3)."
"According to the survey results, the "
most recent relationship amongst the 
respondent group labelled as “women not 
currently married” ended due to various 
"reasons, including divorce (38.0% of IDPs "
"and 28.2% of local women), separation "
(respectively 22.6% and 18.8%) and death 
of partner (36.7% and 50.9%). 
Among the total number of not currently 
"married and never-married respondents, "
4.4% of local women and 6.9% of IDP 
women reported having intimate partners 
with whom they are currently not living 
together.
"Importantly, the marital structure of "
the survey respondents was somehow 
different from the general marital 
structure of the female population of the 
"country. As mentioned, about 40% of the "
interviewed women reported that they 
were not married / partnered at the time 
"of interview, while the corresponding "
proportion of women was 17.2% based 
on  the data of Ukraine’s Demographic 
"and Health Survey in 200717 (respectively, "
"55.3% of women were officially married, "
4.9% of women  lived together with their 
"partners, 22.6% of women had never "
been married). The reasons of such 
discrepancies could be associated with 
the challenges of similar surveys in the 
on-going conflict that we mentioned 
earlier. It is probable that after several 
waves of military mobilization and 
raising the upper age limit for military 
"recruitment in Ukraine, some women "
might be reluctant to provide information 
on their current marital status having 
doubts regarding the confidentiality 
of their responses and fear of possible 
consequences.   The largest share of 
interviewed persons 
(31.4% of local women 
and 30.0% of women 
among IDPs) lived 
in households of 3 
persons (including 
"the respondent), a "
quarter of respondents 
– in households of two 
"persons, another quarter "
of respondents – in 
households of 4 persons 
"(Annex C, Table C.2.).MARITAL STATUS AND COMPOSITION OF HOUSEHOLDS"
This factor should be considered when conducting any 
subsequent analysis of the survey results and interpreting the 
"data, as it could eventually result in data offsets for frequencies "
of responses related to experience of partnership and 
underestimation of intimate partner situations explored by the 
survey.

UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINEThe contents of questionnaires provided 
opportunities to assess not only the 
composition of respondents by their 
socio-economic status at the labour 
"market at the moment of interview, but "
also to trace some changes in the status 
of women’s employment as a result of 
internal displacement (Table. 2.2.2). As 
"compared with IDP respondents, local "
women practically have not experienced 
any changes in their socio-economic 
status due to the conflict in eastern 
Ukraine. In spite of a drop in the share 
of employed women by few percentage 
"points (respectively, shares of unemployed "
"women, women on maternity leaves and "
women engaged in household work have 
"grown), this decline is rather insignificant "
in comparison with striking shifts 
"observed in the employment structure of IDPs. According to the survey results, "
internal displacement caused an almost 
two-fold decline in the share of women 
in employment among IDPs (50% of 
respondents were employed before the 
conflict and only 27.1% remained employed 
at the moment of interview). At the 
"same time, the share of unemployed IDP "
women has grown almost 6 times over 
this period (from 4% before the conflict 
to 24% at the moment of interview). The 
responses of the interviewed IDPs also 
confirm the impact of displacement on the 
opportunities for secondary employment 
for displaced women above retirement age 
and women still in education (students 
and schoolchildren). These results confirm 
that IDPs face problems with finding 
"jobs in the hosting communities, which "
increases their vulnerability.
The survey revealed a very high dependency of IDPs 
on social benefits and cash allowances from the state 
(three quarters of IDP respondents had received such 
incomes at the moment of interview and 28.8% of them 
informed that social benefits were the main source 
"of their incomes). As compared with local women, "
IDPs are also more dependent on financial assistance 
from other family members: 40% of the interviewed 
"IDP women received support from relatives, while "
17% of them regard this support as the main source 
"of incomes (Annex C, Table C.4). As to the structure "
"of incomes of local women, the main contribution "
is provided by official wages at the main job (50% 
"of the interviewed women had such income, while it was the main income source for 44% of them).   As "
to other disparities in the structures of incomes of 
"two groups of respondents, a larger share of incomes "
from secondary (additional) jobs is common for IDP 
women. A suggestion can be made that such structure 
of incomes is determined not only by a smaller role 
"of wages, but also by a need for additional incomes "
to provide for the usual living standards at a new 
"place. On the other hand, the share of incomes "
from subsistence farming is several times smaller 
in the structure of IDP’s incomes as compared with 
"respondents from local communities, because most "
displaced women have lost opportunities to cultivate 
their plots of land.  The contents of 
questionnaires 
provided opportunities 
to assess not only 
the composition of 
respondents by their 
socio-economic status 
at the labour market 
at the moment of 
"interview, but also to "
trace some changes in 
the status of women’s 
employment as a result

IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINEThe last movements reported by the 
respondents took place in October 2015. 
"However, the prevailing number of the "
interviewed IDPs (71.4% of respondents) 
left their homes in June-October of 2014. 
Another 15% of IDP respondents moved to 
new places in November 2014 – February 
2015. 
 A half of IDP respondents (508 persons) 
made a single move to the current place 
"of residence, while 29.6% of them changed "
several communities during the displacement 
period; 28.5% of IDP respondents also 
changed several places of residence within 
the same community. 
Only 45 displaced women (4.5% of the total 
number of IDP respondents) returned home 
"after their displacement; unfortunately, the "
small size of this sub-sample did not allow 
for a representative study of returnees’ life 
circumstances.  
As to the causes and circumstances which 
"forced women to move, more than three "
quarters of respondents mentioned lack of 
"safety in their home communities, including combat operations (Table 2.2.3). About one "
third of IDP respondents reported absence 
of safe housing (31.9% of women informed 
that their homes had been completely or 
"partially ruined), inability to find a job (37.3% "
"of respondents), receive social benefits "
(37.2% of respondents) and buy food (31.3%). 
Almost 30% of women reported that they 
hadn’t seen any future for themselves or their 
families in those given circumstances. 
Although the survey has not revealed any 
significant exclusion of IDPs from basic 
public services as compared with local 
"population (Annex C, Table C.5), women "
from both surveyed groups noted it was 
difficult for them to access some service 
providers in their communities. The largest 
share of respondents were unsatisfied 
with access to administrative services 
"(30.7% of respondents), free medical care "
and receiving social benefits (28.4% of 
respondents each). Every fifth woman 
from the local communities said that it 
"was difficult to access social services, legal "
"services, psychological assistance and "
medical services related to reproductive 
health.  According to the 
"survey results, the "
first population 
displacements started 
as early as January 2014 
(i.e. before the active 
phase of the military 
conflict in Donetsk 
and Lugansk regions) 
when several survey 
respondents left their

IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINE2.3. PREVALENCE OF VIOLENCE OUTSIDE 
 OF THE FAMIL Y DURING THE CONFLICT 
 AND DISPLACEMENT
The survey program was designed in a way to enable a 
comparative analysis of prevalence of violent situations 
faced by women in their communities during the military 
"conflict, at time of displacement and after returning "
home (if applicable). Surveying two distinct groups of 
women allowed for comparing the experiences of IDPs 
"and permanent population of the regions, estimating their "
specific vulnerabilities to gender-based violence in the 
"conflict zones, and exploring their coping strategies. In "
order to clearly identify cases directly related to the armed 
"conflict’s impact, questions in the interviewing forms were "
arranged into separate blocks probing possible cases 
of violence by outsiders (out of family) and by intimate 
partners.Because of low population’s awareness of GBV and 
"difficulties in identifying its manifestations in daily life, "
before asking questions the respondents were provided 
with clear definitions of possible situations related to 
"psychological, economic, physical and sexual violence. "
The interview questions focused on exploring the 
circumstances and consequences of cases deemed most 
serious by the respondents. 
Psychological violence by outsiders 
was assessed by asking women 
whether or not they have experienced 
a situation where they were: (1) 
"intimidated, blackmailed, threatened "
with causing pain or harm to 
"loved ones; (2) humiliated, insulted "
(privately or in front of other people); 
(3) subjected to improper sexual 
comments; (4) forced to watch 
someone being physically assaulted; 
(5) forced to watch someone being 
sexually assaulted. 
Economic violence by outsiders 
was assessed by asking women 
whether or not they have experienced 
a situation where they were: (1) 
squeezed or denuded of their 
money / property; (2) deprived of 
their documents; (3) forced to work 
without pay or for a pittance; (4) not 
allowed to go to work or to study. PSYCHOLOGICAL

"Some women also reported other forms of violence, but they didn’t "
provide any details to describe these specific situations. Such responses 
were aggregated as “other (unspecified) situations” in the subsequent 
analysis.  Physical violence by outsiders was 
assesses by asking women if they 
experienced a situation where they 
were: (1) slapped or hit; (2) choked; 
(3) beaten or kicked; (4) tied up 
or blindfolded; (5) threatened with 
a weapon of any kind; (6) shot or 
"stabbed; (7) deprived of food, water "
or sleep; (8) assaulted causing bodily 
harm; and (9) detained against their 
will. 
Sexual violence was assessed by asking 
women whether they: (1)  were forced 
to remove or stripped of their clothing; 
(2) were subjected to unwanted kisses; 
(3) had their intimate parts touched; 
(4) had their intimate parts beaten; 
(5) were forced or threatened into a 
sexual intercourse; (6) were forced into 
"sex for food, water, protection for their "
"families, or other reasons; (7) forced to "
marry / live together with the violator.

"At large, internally displaced women reported significantly "
larger numbers of violent situations experienced during 
"the conflict, both in absolute and relative terms. In total, "
they reported 352 situations related to any form of 
"violence, including 134 incidences of economic violence, "
"126 occurrences of psychological violence, 14 examples of "
physical violence and 14 incidents of sexual violence (Annex 
"D, Table D.1). The total number of violent incidents reported "
by women from local populations was twice as less (160 
"episodes), including 42 incidences of economic violence, 66 "
"incidences of psychological violence, 36 incidences of physical "
"violence and 11 incidences of sexual violence (Annex D, Table "
"D.2). However, the composition of all violent incidences by "
forms of violence was rather similar for survivors among local 
women and IDPs (Fig. 2.3.2); such proportional compositions 
provide grounds to argue the increased vulnerability of 
displaced persons to all forms of violence during the conflict. 
"At the same time,  the share of economic forms of violence "
"was larger among IDP survivors, including situations when "
"they were forced to give up their money and documents, to "
"work without pay or for a pittance, or not allowed to go to "
work or study.
"As to specific forms of violence, the most prevalent reported "
situations were related to humiliation and insults (5.9% of 
IDP respondents and 3.1% of local women). Among other 
"prevalent forms, both groups of women mentioned being "
"intimidated, blackmailed and threatened; slapped or hit, "
forced to give up their money or documents to a perpetrator; 
forced to work for free or a pittance; and subjected to 
"improper sexual comments (Annex D, Table D.3). Notably, "
local women mostly reported sporadic cases of such 
mistreatment (the majority of cases happened only once or 
"twice during the conflict), while IDPs who experienced similar "
situations before displacement reported they had been quite 
"regular (see Annex D, Table D.1). After displacement, the "
frequency of all forms of violence has significantly dropped 
"(Annex D, Table D.4)."
It is widely acknowledged that sexual violence is 
underreported by sociological surveys due to its socially 
tabooed nature and possible stigmatization of survivors18. 
"Obviously, such underreporting could yet increase at times "
of on-going military conflict due to mistrust in confidentiality 
"of information and fears of reprisal from the assailants. Nevertheless, the survey has revealed several situations "
"directly related to sexual violence by outsiders. In particular, "
13 women (0.5% of all respondents) reported at least one 
situation of sexual violence during the conflict: 5 women were 
from local communities (0.3% of this respondent group) and 
8 women were IDPs (0.8% of respondents). 
"Among the survivors, only two displaced women and three "
local women reported that they were forced to have a sexual 
intercourse. All others mentioned less severe situations 
"(such as unwanted kissing or touching); however, they also "
confirmed some physical injuries and negative psychological 
effects caused by these episodes19. TABLE. 2.3.1  DISTRIBUTION OF WOMEN WHO EXPERIENCED AT LEAST ONE CASE OF VIOLENCE

other persons being sexually assaulted. She reported an 
unwanted pregnancy and then miscarriage as a result of 
this incident. She had multiple injuries but did not apply for 
any medical assistance (no reasons for non-applying were 
given). She didn’t contact law enforcement bodies as she 
was afraid of further violence. She also didn’t tell anyone 
about her experience because she felt ashamed.
She suffered from psychological disorders after this 
"situation, including intrusive memories, nightmares, "
"distorted sleep, permanent feelings of fear or guilt. "
She mentioned deep depression and suicidal thoughts

home and experienced physical and sexual violence there. 
The woman reported that some kind of relationship with her 
"abuser developed, but stated that they were not together at "

"home alone. She received injuries, including bruises and "
"scrapes, joint dislocations, but didn’t apply for any medical "
assistance as she was afraid of further violence. After this 
"episode, the woman often experienced psychological "
"issues (nightmares, intrusive memories, changes in sleep "

"fear and helplessness, detachment from reality and deep "
depression. The woman didn’t apply for socio-psychological 
assistance or for support from law enforcement bodies. She 
"also didn’t tell anyone about this episode, but she believed "
that psychological support would be useful to cope with 
consequences of this situation.
She also experienced intimate partner violence before the 
conflict (including situations related to emotional violence and 
"controlling behaviour, as well as hitting and detention against "
her will); some of these situations took place during the last 
12 months (before a divorce). The main provoking factors of

UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINEWhile about one third of all survivors of 
violence reported it had been committed 
"by unknown individuals, displaced women "
more often reported violent incidents 
committed by military personnel. 
"According to local women, more incidents "
of violence were committed by neighbours 
"/ community members, employers and "
bosses. Single incidents were reported as 
"committed by law enforcement personnel, "
"social workers, medical workers, teachers, "
priests and staff of humanitarian aid 
organizations. 
To explore the circumstances of violent 
"situations during the conflict, both groups "
of respondents were asked to specify 
the most serious episode (if they had 
encountered more than one). Even though 
both groups of respondents mentioned the same forms of violence as the most serious 
"episodes, the generalized circumstances of "
these situations differ significantly between 
these groups (Table 2.3.2). Local women 
mostly reported situations committed 
by one aggressor they knew personally. 
They usually were alone at the time of 
the incident and didn’t face particularly 
serious threats to their safety. It looks like 
most situations were hardly influenced by 
the on-going conflict; they rather reflect a 
snapshot of everyday life of the Ukrainian 
"society. In contrast, displaced women "
mostly reported violent situations caused 
"by a group of strangers, associated with "
direct threats of violence or death to them 
"or witnesses. In contrast to local women, "
IDPs mentioned the checkpoints at the 
demarcation line as locations of increased 
"risk for all forms of violence.  As the survey revealed, "
the experience of 
violence faced by local 
women and IDP women 
is quite different in terms 
of the circumstances of

13.7% of respondents found it difficult to answer this question.
Two thirds of survivors knew the perpetrator personally at the

UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
"IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINEFor  example, one in five local women and "
one in ten displaced women who survived 
any type of violence confirmed getting 
"minor injuries (such as bruises, scrapes "
and welts). Women also reported single 
situations of more serious traumas (deep 
"wounds and bad cuts, joint dislocations), "
sexually transmitted diseases and 
"traumas of reproductive organs, loss of "
consciousness and exacerbation of chronic 
diseases as a result of violent situations. 
The survey also revealed reproductive 
losses as several women reported 
miscarriages. 
"In addition to physical injuries, a lot "
of survivors confirmed a range of 
psychological disorders after the most 
"serious situations (Annex D, Table "
D6). The most prevalent psychological 
problems mentioned by survivors were 
intrusive memories (two thirds of local 
women and almost three quarters of IDP 
"survivors), significant changes in sleep "
patterns (almost 40% of local women and 
more than a half of IDPs) and recurrent 
"nightmares (52% of IDPs), permanent "
feelings of fears or guilt (one third of local 
"women and about 40% of IDPs), feeling of "
helplessness etc. 
Psychological problems after surviving 
violence were not only more prevalent 
"among IDP survivors, but also more "
intense in terms of frequency. The share 
of displaced women who frequently 
experienced negative psychological 
effects was two to three times larger than 
that of local women (depending on the 
"form of disorder). Moreover, almost one "
fourth of IDP survivors reported having a 
"deep depression after the episode, while "
about 5% of them told that they were so 
unhappy that had suicidal thoughts. 
"However, only one in ten survivors applied "
for socio-psychological support to any 
service provider. As to the reasons for 
"non-applying, more than a half of local "
survivors and 41.5% of IDP survivors 
mentioned that they had no need of 
"support (Table 2.3.3). At the same time, "
one fifth of IDP survivors didn’t know 
where to apply to for psychological 
support (21.5% of respondents); 15.5% 
of local women and almost 10% of 
IDP women said that there were no 
proper providers available in their area. 
"Also, 12.7% of local survivors reported that they hadn’t applied for any "
psychological support as they did not 
trust the personnel and experts of these 
institutions.
The similar reasons for non-applying 
were also reported in terms of medical 
"assistance, though the vast number "
of survivors did not apply for medical 
assistance as they had no need (Annex 
"D, Table D.7). As to those women who "
applied to medical institutions (in 
"particular to hospital emergency rooms, "
"city clinics, in-patient institutions and "
"stations of primary medical aid), they "
"used the assistance of traumatologists, "
"surgeons, therapists, ophthalmologist, "
neuropathologist and otolaryngologist.
The prevailing number of survivors 
didn’t report their attacks to the police 
(three quarters of GBV survivors among 
local population and 83.7% of survivors 
"among displaced women) (Annex D, "
Table D.8). Among the most prevalent 
reasons for not involving the police was 
mistrust of law enforcement bodies 
among (15% of local survivors and 20% 
of IDP survivors) and not knowing where 
to ask for the assistance of police (13.3% 
"of IDP survivors). Importantly, one in "
ten survivors among displaced women 
highlighted that they hadn’t reported 
their situation to the police because they 
feared further violence (see Table 2.3.3).
Some women reported that they had 
wished to report their situation to the police 
but were discouraged or their appeals were 
"not accepted, criminal proceedings were "
not initiated or not transferred to the courts 
"(see Annex D, Table D.8). The survey also "
revealed no common practice to apply for 
any legal advice in cases of dealing with 
law enforcement bodies. 
"GENERALLY, THE SURVIVORS OF "

"representatives, psychologists and "
"religious authorities, police and lawyers. "
The GBV survivors among displaced 
women also shared their experience 
with humanitarian relief workers (5.2% 
"of IDP survivors), NGO workers (4.6%) "
and psychologists (3.3% of survivors). 
As to those women who didn’t tell 
"anyone about their experience, they "
mentioned that they’d had no trust in 
anyone or believed that nothing could 
be done to improve their situation. 
The most common reaction to 
reports of violence was emotional 
support from loved ones (reported 
by about 60% of all survivors). One 
in seven women admitted she had 
"been listened to by others, but they "
"did nothing to help her (see Annex D, Table D.8). Only a few women "
reported that they were referred 
"to medical workers and police, "
"psychologists, religious authorities and "
women’s support groups. 
So the analysis of coping strategies 
in case of violence revealed that 
survivors usually find their close 
friends and loved ones most helpful 
"(Annex D, Table D.10). In general, three "
quarters of local women and 80% of 
IDPs surviving any violence said that 
their family members and friends 
have been the most helpful. A very 
few displaced women mentioned that 
NGO representatives and humanitarian 
aid workers have been the most 
"helpful, as well as psychologists and religious authorities. One in ten local "
women reported that medical workers 
were also helpful.
As to possible coping strategies in 
"case of violence in the future, the "
respondents’ expectations are also 
associated with emotional support 
of loved ones (about one third of 
all survivors). As to other potential 
"strategies, the respondents mentioned "
helpful assistance of psychologists 
(13.7% of IDPs and 8.8% of local 
"women), women’s support groups "
(almost 6% of displaced survivors) 
and support of NGOs. One in ten local 
women mentioned possible helpful 
assistance from representatives of law 
enforcement or local authorities.  TABLE 2.3.3. 
REASONS FOR NON-APPLYING FOR VARIOUS TYPES OF SUPPORT BY SURVIVORS OF VIOLENCE 
35 34
UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
"IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINEAmong women from local communities, "
only two respondents reported that they 
were forcibly detained during the conflict 
(since December 2013); yet 7 women 
refused to answer. Both local women 
who confirmed their forced detention 
reported that they had been detained at 
a checkpoint; they were held in detention 
"for 6 and 8 hours, respectively, and didn’t "
then experience physical or sexual violence. 
One of the respondents reported that she 
had experienced 7 situations of forced 
detention during the conflict.
"Among the IDP respondents, 9 women "
reported at least one situation of forcible 
detention during the conflict (and before 
displacement). Most of these episodes took 
"place at women’s homes, 4 situations - at "
the checkpoints. One woman reported 
being forcibly detained for 3 days; 3 were 
detained for 9 to 24 hours; 4 women were 
detained for less than 9 hours. In contrast 
"to local community members, displaced "
women reported situations of physical 
and sexual violence during their forced 
detention.
"Therefore, the survey has confirmed that "
the military conflict in Donetsk and Lugansk 
oblasts resulted in the increased incidence 
"of all forms of violence, including gender-"
"based violence, in areas where combat "
operations took place. A comparison of experience of never-displaced women 
in local communities and women who 
were forced to leave their homes because 
of the conflict argues that the risks of 
all forms of violence are higher among 
IDPs. While there were 153 IDP women 
reporting at least one situation of violence 
"before their displacement, only 49 women "
indicated they had survived at least one 
case of violence after displacement. With 
"regard to relative numbers, the reported "
prevalence of violence among IDPs after 
their displacement has approached the 
prevalence rates reported by local women 
of host communities. 
The conflict’s impact on GBV is not only 
limited by the increased number of violent 
situations and the number of victims. The 
conflict also puts women through violence 
more severe and brutal than in peaceful 
"times, often through direct threats to life "
and with more traumatic consequences. 
The absence of the customary practices 
"to seek help in case of violence, usual lack "
of support services for GBV survivors and 
their total unavailability during combat 
"operations, low level of people’s trust "
towards personnel of the existing service 
institutions and loss of oversight of them 
in large areas by the government – these 
factors describe only part of  the problems 
that make women who have survived 
violence mostly cope alone.  FORCED DETENTION DURING THE CONFLICT
The survey revealed 
several incidents of 
forced detention of 
women during the 
conflict. Such cases 
were reported by 
displaced women 
and local residents of 
the conflict-affected 
"regions. However, the "
"frequency of situations, "
circumstances and 
severity of mistreatments 
were quite different for 
these two groups of 
respondents.

UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINE2.4. PREVALENCE OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE  
 DURING THE CONFLICT 
A special block of questions was devoted to issues of 
intimate partner violence (IPV) in order to explore the 
dynamics of its prevalence as a result of the conflict in 
Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts. To assess the conflict’s 
"impact, the respondents were asked questions about "
their general attitude to IPV and their personal experience 
related to husband’s / partner’s mistreatment during the year preceding the conflict and during the last 12 months 
(at the time of the survey). Additional questions were 
devoted to the experience of IPV during their entire life and 
regarding all partners they’ve ever had. To assess the needs 
"for developing services for survivors of domestic violence, "
we also studied the features of women’s applications for 
help and their vision of IPV coping strategies.  
"Regardless of current marital status, "
more than a half of respondents agreed 
it was important for men to show their 
wives who is the boss in the family 
"(Annex E, Table E.1), while about 41% of "
the interviewed women responded that a 
good wife should obey her husband even 
if she disagreed. The public perception of 
spousal arguments (and conflicts between 
partners) as exclusively a private matter is 
very strong: more than 80% of respondents 
agreed that family problems should be 
"discussed with family members only, while "
only 46.5% of women agreed that other 
people should intervene in a family conflict 
in cases where a man mistreats his wife. 
In spite of the prevalence of stereotypical 
"attitudes, the vast number of women did "
not justify the controlling behaviour of 
men in marriage / partnerships (three 
quarters of respondents agreed that 
women should be able to choose their own 
friends even if the husbands disapproved). 
The respondents were also categorical in 
saying that it was not justified for a man to 
beat his wife (over 90% of all interviewed 
"women, except for situations of unfaithful "
wives). The vast majority of women agreed 
that women have the right to refuse sex to 
her husband in some circumstances (see 
"Annex E, Table E.1). As to helpful coping strategies in case of "
"IPV, more than a half of all respondents "
stated that family members were the most 
helpful persons in these situations (Fig 
2.4.1). Such responses were more prevalent 
among women from local communities 
(65.7% of respondents) as compared with 
displaced women (50.8% of respondents) 
who might have their family ties broken 
due to displacement. Probably friendship 
relations were also broken as a result of 
"displacement, as only 24.3% of IDP women "
found friends helpful in coping with spousal 
violence in contrast to one third of women 
in local communities. 
"Surprisingly, the respondents demonstrated "
rather high expectations of assistance 
"from the police, though only few actual "
GBV survivors applied for assistance to law 
enforcement bodies (as the survey revealed). 
"Moreover, higher expectations of help from "
the police are common for IDPs (43.3% of 
displaced women believed that the police 
"might be helpful in situations of IPV, while "
the corresponding share of local women 
was 31.8%). Some respondents also believed 
in the helpful assistance of psychologists 
(15% of all respondents); one in ten women 
mentioned lawyers and representatives 
of NGOs (those providing assistance to 
women) being helpful as well.  The survey confirmed 
the high prevalence 
of the traditional 
stereotypes on the 
distribution of gender 
roles in the Ukrainian 
society. CIRCUMSTANCES OF VIOLENCE OUTSIDE THE FAMILY 
DURING THE CONFLICT
More than 80% of respondents agreed that family problems 
should be discussed with family members only
37 36
UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINEAll respondents were asked to provide 
their subjective assessments of the 
impact of military conflict in Donetsk 
and Lugansk oblasts on the prevalence 
of IPV. Almost 40% of all respondents 
mentioned that the number of 
arguments between partners increased 
"(Annex E, Table E.2). This opinion was "
most prevalent among the displaced 
women (45% of IDPs against 36% 
"of local women), as well as among "
respondents in Zaporizhzhya and 
Kharkiv oblasts (i.e. in those regions 
which haven’t been directly affected by the military conflict but received a 
lot of displaced people). 
"At the same time, one fifth of all "
women responded that the number 
of arguments between partners 
has not changed (this opinion was 
more characteristic of local women 
"as compared with IDPs), while 11.7% "
of all respondents even argued that 
the number of arguments in families 
has even decreased. The last opinion 
was more wide-spread among 
respondents in Donetsk oblast (17% of total respondents interviewed in the 
region). Such results could reflect the 
important changes in life priorities of 
residents of regions directly affected 
by the conflict: the problem of 
domestic violence could have become 
not so important at a background 
of more serious survival challenges. 
"Also, the extreme conditions of the "
on-going military conflict could have 
resulted in the real consolidation of 
"people in front of more serious threats, "
leading in the respective changes in 
patterns of family behaviour.  FIG 2.4.1.

UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINELess than a half of all currently married / partnered women 
confirmed that they argued or had some sort of conflicts 
with their husbands / partners during the last month. 
One third of them stated that they’d had several conflict 
situations each month; one in ten women had some conflict 
with her partner once a week; about 3% of respondents 
reported that they argued with their husbands / partners 
every day (Fig 2.4.2).
The share of women who hadn’t argued with their husbands 
over the last month was larger among IDP respondents 
(almost a half of them as compared with 42.2% of local 
women). That may be caused by the temporary breakups 
"with their husbands / partners due to displacement, and "
also by the consolidation of family members at new places 
of residence in front of new survival challenges.
"As to the main causes of conflicts between partners, the "
vast number of women mentioned dissatisfaction with 
their living conditions (54% of all respondents) and lack of 
money (41.7% of all respondents). Financial and employment 
problems were more urgent for IDPs as compared with 
"women from local communities (Annex E, Table E.3). Local "
women mentioned unequal distribution of household work 
as a source of conflicts between partners more often (22.2% 
of local women against 12.9% of IDPs). One fourth of all 
respondents reported that they argued with their husbands 
"because of children, while women from local communities "
were also more concerned with alcohol / drugs abuse as 
a reason of spousal conflicts (12.8% of respondents of this 
group).   
When speaking about their personal experience of spousal 
"quarrels, a half of all respondents mentioned that the "
frequency of conflicts with their husbands / partners has 
not changed as a result of the conflict in Donetsk and 
Lugansk oblast. One in ten women highlighted that her 
spousal conflicts have become less frequent;  only one 
fourth of all respondents reported an increased number 
of personal spousal conflicts (Table 2.4.1). The distribution 
of responses was also characterized by some regional 
variation: the prevailing number of respondents interviewed 
"in Zaporizhzhya, Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv oblasts haven’t "
felt significant changes in the prevalence of spousal conflicts 
"in their own families, while respondents from Donetsk oblast "
were more categorical in their opinions –  
regarding both positive and negative assessments. 
"Thus, when summarizing the survey findings related to the "
"general public’s attitudes to IPV, not only the traditional "
stereotypes regarding gender roles in families should be 
"noted, but also that they could possibly be reinforced as "
a result of the conflict. Such a re-orientation of women 
towards more traditional gender roles could be regarded as 
a strategy of survival in the conditions of humanitarian crisis. 
Women are not likely to justify the extreme manifestations 
"of physical violence and controlling behaviour in a marriage, "
but usually do not accept interventions by outsiders when 
"dealing with spousal issues, labelling it as a “private family "
matter”.  PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF INTIMATE PARTNER

UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
"IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINEIn the regional aspect, the highest IPV rates were reported "
by respondents interviewed in Donetsk oblast: over 10% of 
women who were in marital / partner relationship during 
the periods of the survey reported that they experienced 
"at least one form of IPV. However, there were no persistent "
regional variation in the outlined trends; the most dynamic 
changes were recorded in Kharkiv oblast where the share 
of women confirming IPV increased from 5.7% during 
the year preceding the conflict to 8.4% during the last 12 
"months (Annex E, Table E.4)."
The obtained data on IPV look rather underestimated if 
"compared with the results of previous sociological surveys, "
including the 2007 Ukraine Demographic and Health 
"Survey (UDHS)20. According to UDHS-2007, 12.7% of "
married women reported physical violence committed by 
"their most recent husbands/partners, while 22.4% of them "
"faced emotional violence in their marriage / partnership, "
and 3.3% of women experienced some form of sexual 
violence by husbands / partners21. It can be suggested 
that underreporting of IPV situations might be caused by 
women’s concerns about the confidentiality of information 
and fears of reprisal of abusers in the conditions of the 
on-going conflict. The rate of reporting might be also 
influenced by women’s unwillingness to provide any 
information about male household members due to their 
feared possible mobilization to the army (see Paragraph 
2.1). The outlined hypothesis of the traditional gender 
roles getting stronger in the conflict setting shouldn’t be 
neglected. This phenomenon has to be studied in detail by 
social scientists and gender experts. 
Compared to the period preceding the conflict in Donetsk 
"and Lugansk oblasts, the total number of reported "
situations related to the intimate partner violence has 
"decreased (Annexes E5 –E6), but the structure of these "
situations by different types of violence has not changed. 
"Among the situations reported, psychological violence and "
controlling behaviour prevailed (53% of all IPV cases before 
the conflict and 56% of all cases during the last 12 months). 
About a quarter of all situations were related to forms of 
"economic violence in marriage, one fifth of all situations –  "
to forms of physical violence. Only a few percent of all 
"reported situations were related to forms of sexual violence, "
i.e. situations where husbands forced their wives into sex 
against their will (Fig. 2.4.4). As to the most prevalent forms of intimate partner 
"violence, for both periods before the conflict and during "
"the last 12 months, women reported the incidents when "
their husbands / partners humiliated or insulted them or 
made them feel bad about themselves (privately or in 
front of other people); refused to give them money for 
household expenses (even when the spouse had money 
for other things); forbid them from seeing friends; slapped

"21 Obviously, these data cannot be directly compared with the current survey’s results, as the UDHS was designed for another age criteria of respondents (women aged "

UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINEWomen confirming any incidences of IPV were asked 
additional questions to explore the circumstances of these 
"situations, in order to determine the provoking factors "
and to study the practice of seeking help by survivors. 
About 40% of IPV survivors reported that their husbands 
/ partners started such misbehaviour in the first 4 years of 
marriage; many of them (24.7% of local women and 15.4% of 
women among IDPs) confirmed that the first situations of 
the intimate partner violence had taken place during the first 
"year after marriage (Annex E, Table E.7)."
Among the provoking factors of IPV leading to hurtful 
"behaviour of husbands / partners, one third of all survivors "
mentioned problems with money. The second important 
factor mentioned by both groups of women was alcohol 
/ drugs abuse (19.2% of IDP women and 16.5% of local 
women). One quarter of local women also mentioned that 
"partner’s mistreatment was provoked by his jealousy, but "
only 7.7% of displaced women had the same opinion. 
About one fourth of all women who survived any incident 
of intimate partner violence knew that their husbands / 
partners had previously experienced some violence in their 
"own families as children or adolescents (see Annex E, Table "
E.7). These data allow tracing a link between patterns of 
behaviour in the family learnt in childhood and personal 
experience of marital relations.
"In general, domestic violence is a controversial problem "
"that may affect various household members, including "
"men. Thus, 139 married or partnered women (6.2% of "
all respondents of this group) reported that had beaten 
their husband or partner while he hadn’t done them any 
harm. One third of them confirmed that they had such 
an experience during the military conflict in Donetsk and 
Lugansk oblasts.
The analysis of the life-long experience of IPV among 
respondents (with consideration of all their partners) reveals 
a significantly larger extent of the problem than what the 
"experience of recent years demonstrates. Thus, more than "
12% of all married or partnered women confirmed that they 
had been physically injured as a result of mistreatment 
by her husband / partner (these data are well-correlated 
with the rates of physical violence in marriage provided 
by UDHS-2007). As many as 7.2% of married or partnered 
respondents were forced to leave their homes because of 
husband’s / partner’s mistreatment; 3.3% of women received 
serious injuries as a result of such situations (such as deep 
"cuts, broken teeth or bone fractures); 3.2% of women were "
"forced to seek outpatient care because of the injuries, and "
about 1% of women were hospitalized after such incidents 
"(Annex E, Table E.8). Importantly, among those women who "
"sought medical care because of injuries, more than one third "
never told health workers the cause of their injuries (Annex 
"E, Table E.9)."
When analysing the consequences of IPV in the context of 
"women’s health, special attention should be paid to another unacceptable aspect of domestic violence. At the time of "
"interviews, 77 women reported that they had been subjected "
to beatings by their husband / partner during pregnancy 
(3.4% of all women who reported ever being pregnant). 
One in ten women stressed that there were no special 
circumstances that would provoke her husband to such 
"behaviour (Annex E, Table. E.10). Among other respondents, "
about a half of women who have survived such incidents 
explained the situation happened because of alcohol or drug 
abuse by the husband; 27.3% of respondents believed that 
"the incident was caused by jealousy. Among other reasons, "
the survivors mentioned spousal problems with employment 
and finances. The survey confirmed that such misbehaviour 
could result in significant reproductive losses – one fifth of 
women who had been beaten during pregnancy reported a 
miscarriage or premature birth after these attacks.
The study into individual coping strategies in cases of 
IPV showed no common practice of seeking any form of 
assistance in such situations. About 60% of survivors did not 
apply for any assistance and didn’t share their experience 
"with anyone (Annex E, Table E.11). Among women who "
"sought support, most of them asked for help from their "
"parents (one in ten survivors of domestic violence), other "
family members and friends. Only a few women sought help 
from the law enforcement agencies (4.4% of respondents); 
"there were also single cases of appeals to medical workers, "
psychologists and religious workers. When reflecting on 
"helpful coping strategies in case of IPV, women tend to trust "
their friends and close family members; some women showed 
expectations of support from psychologists and special 
women’s groups.
It should be emphasized that more than one third of IPV 
survivors are desperate in terms of opportunities to get any 
"help, because they believe that no one can help in similar "
situations (this share is significantly larger among displaced 
"women - see Annex E, Table. E.11). According to the survey "
"results, about a half of all IPV survivors do not know how to "
deal with a possible attack from their husband or partner 
in the future. That makes the need for information and 
education campaigns on safety planning for survivors of 
"domestic violence urgent, as well as raising their awareness "
of the system of services for women who face similar 
situations.
"In general, the survey confirmed that the society still treats "
domestic violence as a common and usual practice and 
"deals with it quite tolerantly, except for the extreme forms of "
"physical violence. However, the military conflict in Donetsk "
and Lugansk oblasts has not resulted in a significant 
increase in the rates of intimate partner violence. This can 
be explained by the flaws of case under-reporting during 
"sociological surveys in the conflict settings, particularly, "
by women’s unwillingness to report such incidents fearing 
possible reprisal from abusers or subsequent mobilization 
"of their husbands or partners into the military, and also "
by more complex social processes transforming the social 
norms and roles in the conditions of humanitarian crises.  CIRCUMSTANCES OF SITUATIONS OF IPV AND SURVIVORS’

UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINE2.5. CURRENT MENTAL HEAL TH  
 AND WELL-BEING OF RESPONDENTS
Acknowledging the sensitive character of questions and 
their possible traumatic effect for women who have recently 
"survived violence, the respondents were asked about their "
current mental health and well-being. These questions were 
posed to estimate possible psychological disorders and to 
provide referrals to the proper service providers in case of a 
"need. At the end of interview, all respondents were provided "
with updated information on institutions providing support 
to GBV survivors in the surveyed regions.
"At the time of interview, most respondents did not "
demonstrate significant psychological disorders or stressful 
states: about a half of local women stated that they felt no 
"psychological disorders more than usually (Annex F, Table "
"F.1). Furthermore, from 10 to 35% of local women said they "
didn’t feel any psychological issues at all. Only 7% of local 
women said that they were unable to enjoy their normal 
"day-to-day life more often than usually, 6% of them lost "
sleep over worries and felt constantly under strain much 
more than usual. Less than 5% of respondents said that 
"they’d lost self-confidence, felt unhappy and depressed."
"However, the psychological status of displaced women "
interviewed during the survey was not so positive. Almost 
one third of them reported various stressful disorders 
expressed more than usual. The proportion of respondents 
who said they felt no psychological disorders at all 
was about twice as less as that of women from local 
communities. More than 15% of IDP women stressed 
that they had recently faced psychological issues much 
"more often than usual: sleeplessness over worries, feeling "
"constantly under strain, inability to enjoy a normal day-to-"
"day life, lost self-confidence. Almost 14% of IDP women "
"mentioned that they had been feeling unhappy, unable to "
face their problems and depressed much more than usual. 
These results confirm the existence of negative 
psychological consequences of experiencing internal 
"displacement, surviving humanitarian crisis and deprivation "
"of the normal way of life faced by IDPs, as well as their "
"increased vulnerability in terms of personal safety during the military conflict. Therefore, an urgent need for the "
development of accessible service of psychological 
assistance (including emergency psychological support) 
is important not only for those women who directly 
"faced violence during the conflict, but also for other IDPs. "
"Permanent anxiety, uncertainty and frustration in the future "
may lead to development of long-term psychological effects 
"and affect the quality of life for this population in the future, "
causing the increased risks of violence in and outside the 
family. 
As to the coping strategies for improving the emotional 
"state, the vast majority of respondents mentioned the "
importance of family support (74% of local women and 
69% of women among IDPs) and support of friends (47% 
of local women and 40% of women among IDPs). Among 
"other means, the respondents called the assistance of "
"psychologists, religious workers and women’s support "
"groups. Overall, IDPs demonstrated significantly higher "
"expectations of support from external service providers, "
while expectations of local women were largely associated 
"with help of family members and friends (Annex F, "
Table F.2). It might be assumed that such distribution of 
responses is caused by possibly broken ties among friends 
"and relatives due to displacement, as well as by higher "
dependence of IDPs on the external help - both of public 
institutions and civil society organizations dealing with their 
problems.
"It the end of interviews, all women were asked about their "
"current well-being after questioning. Positively, the vast "
majority of respondents did not feel any negative impact 
of the survey: more than a half of women among IDPs and 
62.7% of local women did not specify any changes in their 
emotional state after responding to the questionnaire. 
"Moreover, about 30% of respondents of both target "
groups stressed that they felt good or better after talking 
with interviewers (Table 2.5.1). It proves the importance of 
"any psychological support to GBV survivors, as even the "
opportunity to share their experience with someone else 
could improve the emotional state of these women.

IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINE3.1. PUBLIC ATTITUDE TO THE PROBLEM OF GBV  
 AND ASSESSMENT OF IMPACT OF THE MILITARY  
 CONFLICT ON GBV PREVALENCE
The qualitative assessment of situation with GBV 
prevalence and community attitudes in the conflict-
affected regions of Ukraine is based on the data of 
focus group discussions conducted at the beginning 
of October 2015. Two focus group discussions (up to 
10 participants each) were organized in each region 
"covered by the study, including Kramatorsk town "
"(Donetsk region), Severodonetsk town (Lugansk "
"region), Dnepropetrovsk city (Dnepropetrovsk region), "
"Berdyansk town (Zaporizhzhya region), Izyum and "
Lozovaya towns (Kharkiv region)
The target groups of the qualitative assessment were 
represented by women and men of various ages living 
in the settlements of these regions. Methodological 
approaches to recruiting and selection of participants 
are presented in Annex G. Considering the high 
"sensitivity of topics investigated, separate groups were "
"organized for men and women, while discussions were "
facilitated by the same-sex moderators. Thereby the 
maximum level of comfort was ensured for participants 
to provide frank and open responses in the absence of 
any pressure and biased attitude between genders.  SECTION 3. 
QUALITATIVE STUDY OF GENDER-
BASED VIOLENCE IN THE CONFLICT-
AFFECTED REGIONS BASED ON DATA 
OF FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS WITH 
REPRESENTATIVES OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES
THE TOPIC GUIDE FOR FOCUS 
GROUP DISCUSSIONS COVERED THE 
FOLLOWING ISSUES:
"•	general moods in the society, changes to the "
"routine life of communities, changes in relations "
between women and men as a result of military 
conflict in Donetsk and Lugansk regions;
•	attitude to the internally displaced persons in local 
communities;
•	assessment of the situation with GBV spreading in 
local communities and its linkages with the military 
conflict in Donetsk and Lugansk regions;
"•	understanding forms and dimensions of GBV, "
including domestic violence and sexual violence; 
"identification of vulnerable population groups, "
assessment of risk factors that can influence GBV 
levels; 
•	general attitude to problems of gender inequality 
"in the society, prevalence of gender stereotypes "
and their influence on interpersonal relations in 
communities.
The results of detailed analysis of 
protocols of focus group discussions 
in the conflict-affected regions 
demonstrated quite predictable 
disparities in perceptions of residents 
of communities of Donetsk and 
Lugansk regions situated closely to 
"the area of military operations, and "
representatives of the neighbouring 
"regions. Compared with respondents from Lugansk and Donetsk regions, "
residents of neighbouring territories 
have not felt such a strong effect of the 
conflict in eastern Ukraine in terms of 
"their everyday life (“basically, all things "
"remain the same… - the bad, the good "
"things. Just like in real life” - a woman, "
Dnipropetrovsk region). Estimates 
of representatives of the liberated 
towns of Donbas who participated in the discussions are more drastic and 
"emotional in most cases, while their "
positions on the proposed topics are 
more clear and stressed. It should also 
be noted that their statements were 
more open; they did not demonstrate 
any willingness to evade the discussion 
of “uncomfortable” issues and sensitive 
topics or provide the “necessary” 
answers and the “expected” assessments.

UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINEATTITUDE TO THE INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS
IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES. ASSESSMENT OF THEIR VULNERABILITY
IN TERMS OF PREJUDICE AND VIOLENCE.
"In the overwhelming majority, the participants of discussions  "
"from all regions demonstrated a tolerant attitude to the displaced persons,  "
as well as an understanding of their problems and needs.  
Except for incidents related to an 
unwillingness to rent apartments 
to IDPs (Dnipropetrovk oblast) or 
"raising rents (Kharkiv oblast), the "
representatives of communities were 
unable to report on any specific cases 
of prejudice against IDPs.
“I haven’t noticed any displays 
that these people are 
distinguished as the displaced 
ones. They have dissolved in 
"some way” (a man, Berdyansk). "
They are unanimous in their 
assessments of a high level of 
sympathy and willingness to assist the 
displaced persons demonstrated by 
residents of their settlements at the 
beginning of the conflict:
- “We had sympathy to the 
"displaced persons” (a woman, "
Berdyansk);
- “Our town responded to all 
displaced persons in a very 
friendly way. There were many 
"displaced persons, and our "
"people were bringing clothes, "
food. The headquarters were 
"created, all of us understood "
that these people need 
"to be supported” (a man, "
Novomoskovsk). 
"However, the statements "
of focus group participants 
reveal some changes in the 
attitude of local communities 
to the displaced people as 
time passes: 
"“But later, as some time "
"passed, when displaced "
"persons refused employment, "
the attitudes started to 
change someway... They make 
"demands, as if we are obliged "
to do something for them. But 
they do not participate in the 
creation of their own well-
"being” (a man, Dnipropetrovsk "
oblast); “They demonstrate 
"such a consumer attitude, as if "
all people are obliged to them” 
"(a man, Izyum).Except criticism of “dependency” "
"moods of the displaced persons, "
representatives of communities 
express some concerns related to the 
increased pressure on local budgets 
"(“As to modular houses, they "
are at the town’s balance. That 
"means servicing, electricity, "
water supply… The budget is on 
Nikopol residents. That’s why 
many of them... have negative 
attitude to this modular town” 
"- a man, Nikopol), "
while young people – in terms of 
competitiveness at the labour market 
as a result of inflow of labour force: 
“They have a priority in the 
employment centres … They 
"push aside our guys” (a man, "
"35 y.o., Nikopol), “Displaced "
persons get employed... they 
occupy some part of jobs at 
"the labour market” (a woman, "
Berdyansk); “Displaced persons 
are placed in jobs in the first 
"turn, provided with social "
allowance. While the same 
low-income persons living 
here do not receive anything… 
"just surviving” (a man, "
Severodonetsk).
Another aspect of negative 
attitudes to IDPs should be paid 
"attention, as it is gradually being "
formed in the communities of the 
host regions:  the arrival of 
newcomers is associated with 
the deterioration of crime 
"situation, increased number "
"of thefts, robberies and car "
thefts 
(“More thefts are observed. 
Everyone began to say that 
"this is Donbass” - a woman, "
Izyum town; “Crime situation 
.... Bad things happen… near 
these houses [modular - ed.] ... 
"“ – a man, Nikopol)."
"However, none of the participants "
supported the assumption that IDPs face the increased risk of 
"violence, including GBV, in the "
host communities. As a result of 
"discussions, a possible risk "
group was outlined – minor 
children and adolescents 
evacuated from their 
settlements without parents 
or living without proper 
supervision at the moment  
"(for example, students who moved "
"away with their schools, children from "
boarding schools evacuated during 
the fighting or those children who 
have lost their parents). 
"“When a child is left alone, "
you can actually do anything 
with him or her... That’s for girls 
"and adolescents, it is a very "
"difficult situation now” (a man, "
Novomoskovsk). 
Focus group participants emphasize 
the vulnerability of this category 
of young people in terms of sexual 
abuse – not only due to their lack of 
"life experience, but also because of a "
"poor economic status, which can be "
exploited by perpetrators.
45 44
UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINEComparative analysis of statements 
of the focus group participants from 
various regions of eastern Ukraine 
allows tracing quite clear discrepancies 
in estimates of GBV prevalence 
expressed by representatives of 
Donetsk and Lugansk regions and 
residents of the neighbouring areas.
"In particular, residents "
of Zaporizhzhya and 
Dnipropetrovsk oblasts didn’t 
support the thesis that an 
increase in sexual violence 
has been observed in their 
regions due to the military 
conflict. 
Although the problem of sexual 
violence is recognized as a relevant 
one for most settlements represented 
"by panellists, they agree that such "
facts are of a singular character. 
"Moreover, those specific cases "
mentioned by participants mostly 
took place long before the conflict. As 
"for the Kharkiv region, the position of "
the panellists was not so clear: several 
women suggested an increased rate 
of sexual violence after the beginning 
"of military operations, but such "
assumptions were not supported by 
objective facts; they were expressed as 
subjective feelings.
"At the same time, some panellists "
suggested that the media deliberately do not cover these aspects of 
"criminal news presently, so as not "
to aggravate the situation in the 
"society, not to promote a negative "
image of the country and its  regions. 
There are opinions that some facts 
are purposefully hidden from the 
"public, have been suppressed by the "
responsible authorities 
(“We know only about official  
facts. But how many are there 
"unofficial ones?” – a woman, "
Berdyansk; “Similar cases are 
very rare to be widely imposed 
to the public ... Only really 
high-profile cases ... which 
led to completely irreversible 
"consequences “- a man, "
Berdyansk).
All participants of group discussions 
agreed on the general aggravation of 
the crime rate in their towns including 
increased numbers of thefts and 
robberies in the streets. 
"“I think, there is less sexual "
"violence recently, it has faded "
"into the background, as "
compared with economic crime” 
"- woman, Dnipropetrovsk "
region.
They are also unanimous in 
recognizing the fact that women 
are more vulnerable to such 
manifestations of crime: “I think that each of us has 
"faced a robbery, at least a small "
one. I was robbed at night by 
"three men. Indeed, it’s scary” (a "
"woman, Berdyansk); “It is easier "
"to rob a woman” (a woman, "
Dnipropetrovsk region); ”It is 
"simpler, easier, for potential "
thieves to rob a woman“  (a 
"man, Kramatorsk)."
Compared with residents of 
"the neighbouring regions, "
representatives of Donetsk 
and Lugansk regions are 
significantly more concerned 
with an increase in other 
forms of violence in their 
"communities – in particular, "
physical and sexual violence: 
"“Of course, in our region, in "
particular in the area of the 
"ATO, there is probably the "
highest rate of gender-based 
violence in Ukraine. First of all 
"- men against women” (a man, "
Severodonetsk). 
The respondents agree that the 
regions have traditionally been 
characterized by negative criminal 
situation and high rates of crimes of 
sexual nature
(“We always had violence 
against women. It is not just 
now. It has been always and 
probably will be forever” - a ASSESSMENT OF THE SITUATION WITH GBV PREVALENCE IN THE REGIONS OF 
EASTERN UKRAINE AND THE CORRESPONDING CHANGES CAUSED BY THE IMPACT 
OF THE MILITARY CONFLICT
SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN THE SOCIETY 
"(OUTSIDE THE FAMILY). The key finding of focus group discussions is as follows: in the mass perception of the population, "
"there is a clear distinction between those forms of violence that may occur in a family, and gender-"
"based (sexual) violence that is happening outside the family. The attitudes to these problems differ, "
as well as perceptions in the context of criminal liability and severity of these offenses. While the 
facts of sexual abuse cause outrage among community representatives and a desire to bring those 
"liable to justice, domestic violence is primarily considered a normal phenomenon that shouldn’t "
attract the attention of the society. Involvement of law enforcement agencies in dealing with 
conflict situations within families is accepted only in cases of extreme forms of physical violence 
resulting in severe injuries to victims.  
47 46
UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
"IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINEwoman, Kramatorsk town). "
They also trace a direct link between 
the military conflict and increased rates 
of sexual violence: 
“Women always suffer at times 
"of all armed conflicts, and "
women become the object of 
sexual violence often. I am sure 
that this happened more than 
once in this conflict also”- a 
"man, Severodonetsk."
In spite of non-acceptance of 
"sexual violence in the society, "
the trends of victimizing the 
survivors are still common 
in the public mentality; 
survivors are considered 
partially responsible for 
their attackers’ actions and 
in some cases even openly 
blamed for provocative 
behaviour. Both women and men 
quite unanimously suggested that 
a woman can be guilty of a sexual 
assault happening to her. 
“If we consider violence against 
"women, victims are to blame "
in 90 percent of cases. Not 
even the fact that she went 
to the wrong place. She is 
provoking often or behaving in 
"an inappropriate way” (a man, "
Berdyansk). 
Among the factors which can provoke 
"sexual violence, the participants "
mention alcohol drinking by women 
"or girls, wearing scanty clothing and "
"provocative behaviour, promiscuity in "
"relations and choice of friends, lack of "
general norms of safe behaviour:
"- “Provocatively dressed”, "
“provoking appearance 
"and behaviour“ (a woman, "
Berdyansk); 
- “It is not enough that she is 
"drunk, she is returning home "
"late at night”, “she can become "
drunk in a company of drunk or 
"non-controlling persons” (men, "
Kramatorsk);
- “It is not even a matter of a 
"short skirt, it’s about the culture "
of behaviour. And the culture 
"of a woman, a girl herself. She "
needs to understand where she is going to and with whom” (a 
"woman, Kramatorsk )."
When analysing the trends in GBV 
since the beginning of the military 
conflict in Donetsk and Lugansk 
"regions, focus group participants "
emphasize the contemporary 
stabilization and significant 
improvements as compared to the last 
year:
"- “You know, all those things "
are forgotten very quickly. The 
events of the last year emerge  
"in my mind – it was very true, "
indeed. If you have conducted 
a discussion at least a few 
"months earlier, there would be "
"more impressions, more cases. "
There would be more stories to 
"tell” (a man, Severodonetsk);"
- “There was violence last year. 
"Basically, in the villages, not so "
"much in towns. Maybe, people "
"were afraid to complain. Again, "
whom could they complain? 
To police? There are military  
personnel everywhere ... There is 
much less violence this year” (a 
"woman, Severodonetsk);"
"- “Recently, I haven’t heard "
about sexual violence ... I had 
"heard about it last year”(a man, "
Kramatorsk);
- “With the beginning of 
"military operations, the influx "
of surviving women has grown 
"significantly” (a woman, "
Kramatorsk); “After liberation of 
"the city, the rate is decreasing "
[the rate of sexual violence] 
...There were more cases before 
"the occupation. Of course, a "
huge number was observed at 
the time of the occupation. It 
has been just an unbearable 
"hell” (a woman, Kramatorsk)."
The respondents link normalization 
of the situation to presence of the 
organized patrols constraining possible 
"(and, sometimes, well-familiar to "
communities) violence performed by 
the civilian population. 
“Given such presence of 
"military  personnel in our city, "
the crime and violence rates 
have become much lower” 
"(a man, Kramatorsk). “I think that with the arrival of the "
"military men, there are less "
violent actions committed by 
"civilian population” (a man, "
Severodonetsk).
"However, participants of "
discussions express concerns 
about the possible increase 
of violence in the future 
because of a large number of 
arms in hands of citizens and 
uncontrolled circulation of 
arms in the region: 
“The rate of violence… has 
really become lower. But this 
is a hidden parameter. I think 
that given so many weapons 
distributed and circulating 
"around Donbas, it can emerge "
any time ... It’s just enough to 
"get weapons and camouflage, "
"and to wear a mask” (a man, "
Kramatorsk ).
"On the other hand, the local "
residents associate their 
largest anxiety with presence 
of military forces; they 
perceive men in uniform as 
the main source of threat to 
their security. 
“Armed men make a 
"psychological impact, pressure” "
"(a man, Severodonetsk). "
The panellists informed about 
circumstances of physical violence 
"by armed men in uniform (threats, "
"beatings, confiscating documents etc.). "
“It was hard in the first days 
after the arrival of military 
personnel. There are some 
people among my friends who 
were very hard to go over it” (a 
"man, Severodonetsk)."
While discussing vulnerable population 
groups that run the increased risk 
"of violence, the residents of areas "
neighbouring Donbas assert that 
women and girls are more vulnerable 
"to robberies, theft and sexual violence. "
The representatives of Donetsk and 
Lugansk regions are not so unanimous 
in their assessments. There are some 
other voices: 
“Women are even safer than 
men in  the streets today” 
47 46
UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINE(Severodonetsk).
They highlighted the 
increased risks of physical 
violence against men due to 
the conflict: 
“They start to look more closely 
"at men” (a man, Kramatorsk)."
People from the Lugansk region 
are even more categorical in their 
statements: 
“Men have suffered more in our 
"region” (a man, Severodonetsk), "
“there was less violence 
"against women” (a woman, "
Severodonetsk). 
The panellists broadly talk about facts 
"of men disappearing, kidnapping off "
the street in front of passers-by 
(“There were so many cases 
when they were just picked 
up.  A bag on his head… 
almost everyone was taken 
"prisoner ... Who knows, where "
"they were taken?” - a woman, "
Severodonetsk). 
Among the circumstances associated 
"with the increased risk of violence, "
the respondents noted checks of 
documents and examinations at 
"checkpoints, simply being in the street, "
especially after curfew 
“Conflict often happens when 
they check your documents. If 
"you say something wrong, they "
"begin” (a man, Severodonetsk).  "
That is why some women subjectively 
feel themselves rather safer than men: 
“So it’s better that I go to the 
shop myself in the evening 
"than send a man, honestly” (a "
"woman, Severodonetsk)."
The respondents have not heard about 
cases of sexual violence against men in 
their communities; they noted that 
“this can happen only in prisons” 
"(a man, Berdyansk). "
"However, they agree that such cases "
are more hushed than sexual violence 
against women and consider it highly unlikely that male victims will seek help 
and disclose their cases. 
"“I think, such events are taking "
place. But I don’t think they 
"will come out somewhere, that "
someone will talk about this” (a 
"woman, Izyum)."
Residents of Donbas say 
that the most dangerous 
places in terms of violence 
are the checkpoints on the 
demarcation lines. They focus 
attention on the impunity that can 
further produce illegal actions and 
demonstrate persistent 
expectations regarding 
probable silence and 
concealment of such violence 
by officials: 
“If there is some kind of violence 
"made at the checkpoint, and "
the leadership is 100% aware 
"of it, they still will not take any "
action. They encourage it”; 
"“They will defend their men, not "
"the population” (a man, Lugansk "
region).
Such hostile attitude to people in 
uniform can be traced not only in the 
"cities directly affected by the conflict, "
but also among remote communities: 
“They believe that if they are 
wearing a uniform ... or they are 
"on their duty, at some position, "
so they can afford everyone and 
"everything. That is, there are "
"no moral values, they lose their "
"values” (a woman, Berdyansk), "
“They feel unpunishable. They 
often behave aggressively” 
"(women, Izyum)."
"At the same time, the participants of "
discussions in Donetsk and Lugansk 
regions observed some changes 
in the patterns of women’s 
"and girls’ behaviour, which "
can be related to specific 
survival strategies at times of 
crisis and military conflict:
- “There are such places where 
girls like to go. Because they 
know that there are military 
men. Military men have lots 
of money” (Kramatorsk town); 
"“Now, our guys rarely can afford "
"to relax ... and the girls are looking for some strangers, "
from another region. Girls hope 
that they will be taken away” 
(Severodonetsk town).
Representatives of neighbouring 
regions also noted the impact of 
numerous military contingents on 
the marital situation in the local 
communities:
"- “Divorce rates have increased, "
"even if not official, but families "
are not living together... The 
families are separated because 
women left for soldiers” (a 
"woman, Izyum); "
“There were some episodes... 
"When soldiers arrived, a wife "
left her husband for a soldier; 
they got married and now have 
... their children... If girls are 
"young, they are interested. They "
were bored with local guys.” (a 
"woman, Izyum)."
"Finally, the panellists stress upon "
another aspect of the increased risk of 
GBV associated with the consequences 
of the armed conflict: “Young people 
"who came back from the ATO, "
they are mentally compromised. 
"Naturally, we cannot expect any good "
"outcomes” (a woman, Berdyansk). "
Representatives of local 
communities are well aware 
of possible psychological 
disorders among demobilized 
soldiers returning to their 
families; they understand 
the need to provide them 
with psychological support 
in order to ensure a gradual 
adaptation and return to daily 
"life. In this regard, the problem of "
"domestic violence is very relevant, as it "
has a clear gender dimension.

"Most likely, even at home, in a "
"family” (a woman, Berdyansk); “I "
think that women have become 
aggressive to all the events 
"... towards the authorities, "
"towards actions of men” (a man, "
Dnipropetrovsk region).
The panellists also agree on the 
increased number of conflicts in 
"families, in particular because of political "
"grounds. Almost in all regions, they recall "
some cases of broken communication 
between relatives as a result of these 
disparities. 
“The society is divided. I know 
even cases where it came to 
"separation of families (a woman, "
Berdyansk); “Families are 
"breaking up, people are fighting "
"with each other” (a woman, "
Kramatorsk). 
"However, the mentioned contradictions "
are mostly expressed in the form of 
emotional debates; they do make a 
significant influence on the rate of 
physical violence within families. 
“There are more... verbal 
skirmishes. I think it does not 
"reach the massacre”(a man, "
Lozova).
The women’s group of respondents 
argues that those conflicts in families 
that increased during the military 
"confrontation in Donbass, did not "
emerge directly because of the conflict; 
“The long-standing problems 
and contradictions crop up” 
"during the conflict (a woman, "
Berdyansk). 
The respondents also emphasized the 
secondary nature of these domestic 
quarrels in front of the nation’s 
problems; it is particularly clearly 
recognized by residents of the liberated 
cities of Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts: “These petty domestic quarrels 
are not so significant now” (a 
"woman, Kramatorsk)."
While speaking about the increased 
number of conflict situations in 
"“large” families, i.e. between different "
"generations and relatives, the "
representatives of all communities 
of eastern regions claim that  
these processes are not so 
observable in marital and 
"partner relations; in contrast, "
they say that 
“men became more 
uncompromising in some 
"political matters, but they "
treat their families softer and 
"more attentively” (a woman, "
"Kramatorsk), “A family that was "
"on the verge of collapse, became "
closer due to this conflict” (a 
"woman, Severodonetsk). "
They noted some positive 
changes in the women’s 
attitudes towards their own 
"husbands, including more "
"compassion, increased desire "
to devote more attention and 
care to them: 
“Women pay more respect to 
"their men, take care and value "
"them, because they can be taken "
"away to war”, “As to women, their "
first thought arises about the 
loss of a breadwinner at time of 
"mobilization ... Accordingly, the "
"value of a close person, of a man, "
"is increasing for women” (men, "
Severodonetsk). 
Women from the liberated cities of the 
Donetsk region also tell about personal 
changes in attitudes towards their 
husbands: 
"“Presently, I even began to "
respect him. I’m looking at 
"him differently” (a woman, "
Kramatorsk).
Acknowledging the absence of 
correlation between the armed conflict 
in eastern Ukraine and trends of 
"domestic violence, both women "
and men agree that domestic 
violence is very common in the 
Ukrainian society in general.  
Almost every discussion participant 
"speaks about known cases of violence in the families of friends, relatives and "
neighbours. The respondents also 
remember situations when they had to 
provide direct assistance to survivors: 
"“I’ve seen many people, I’ve "
heard and read about... I had 
girlfriends which resorted to 
"me in the night” (a woman, "
Berdyansk).
Some women are even hesitant to share 
their personal experiences of violence in 
families: 
“Among the reasons of my 
"divorce, indeed, there was "
domestic violence. Physical 
"violence, by my former husband... "
"Emotional violence, by mother-"
"in-law, her family. I don’t know "
how I’ve lived it all through. 
When he raised his hand at 
"me twice, I’ve just realized – "
"that’s it for me, it has already "
"become systematic...” (a woman, "
Berdyansk); 
"in some cases, they recall the extreme "
"manifestations of violence – beatings, "
"threats of weapons, heavy injuries etc."
Women recalling their personal 
experience of physical violence by 
intimate partners belong to different 
age groups; they have different socio-
"economic status, different levels of "
education. 
"Thus, an assumption can be "
made that the risks of domestic 
violence exist among all 
population groups of Ukraine 
regardless of their socio-
demographic characteristics or 
material well-being.
The panellists were unable to come to 
a single conclusion on what gender is 
facing domestic violence more often: 
"“Women always suffer – morally, "
financially and physically” (a 
"woman, Berdyansk); “It seems "
"to me, that both parties may "
"suffer” (a man, Kramatorsk). "
They agree that women suffer 
much more from physical 
"violence; however, there are "
suggestions that men could 
suffer from psychological DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINEviolence as well: 
“Women probably suffer from the 
physical point of view – because 
men are stronger. But there 
is some kind of psychological 
"violence ... In this sense, men "
"could be more exposed” (a man, "
Kramatorsk). 
Among the manifestations of 
"such psychological violence, male "
respondents mentioned “insults and 
"humiliation expressed by women”, denial "
to communicate with children after 
"divorce, accusations of low earnings and "
inability to feed the family.
The debates about the possibility of 
sexual violence in a marriage did not 
lead to a unified position of respondents; 
their assessments varied within a wide 
range regardless of gender or age: 
"“For example, I do not consider "
"it a rape ... in fact, it’s the duty "
"of a wife” (a woman, 61 y.o., "
Berdyansk);  “It is definitely a 
rape – psychologically and 
"physically” (a man, Kramatorsk)."
Among the risk factors 
"of domestic violence, the "
respondents indicated 
"the economic crisis, "
unemployment and scarcity of 
money: 
“No work. Not enough money. 
"Naturally, people are angry at "
"each other ... Of course, family "
relationships also get worse” (a 
"woman, Severodonetsk). "
They also agree in foreseeing the 
increased risk of conflicts in families 
given further deterioration of the 
population’s living standards: 
“I think that conflicts and 
"scandals will increase in families, "
as new bills for gas are arriving” 
"(a man, Kramatorsk)."
"However, the main factors of intimate "
partner violence are related to alcohol 
"abuse (“The main reason, of course, "
"is alcohol” (a man, Dnipropetrovsk "
"region)), morbid spousal jealousy "
and disputes over child’s upbringing. 
The respondents also draw attention 
"to some deeper, psychological prerequisites for domestic violence "
"“Women are crying , while men "
keep it mostly inside ... At some 
"point, all of this breaks down” (a "
"man, Berdyansk). "
Some participants pay attention to 
the fact that propensity to domestic 
violence is laid as a result of careless 
upbringing of a child inherited as bad 
example of their parents or close friends; 
it may be caused by unwillingness to 
listen to the thoughts of others 
“People often quarrel because 
they are trying to remake each 
"other” (a man, Kramatorsk)."
Men are more likely to justify physical 
"domestic violence, in particular they "
recognize husband’s right to punish his 
"wife in case of “cheating, inconsistency "
"to a status of a good wife, neglect "
"of children” (a man, Dnipropetrovsk "
region). 
Women mostly do not recognize 
"such rights of men, but their views on "
obedience to their husbands differ. The 
attributes of patriarchal culture are more 
prevalent among older women who 
agree that “a good wife should obey her 
husband in everything”.
The statements of panellists 
confirmed high tolerance 
to domestic violence in the 
Ukrainian society. 
"The respondents, both men and women, "
demonstrated a unanimous opinion 
that outsiders should not interfere in 
"spousal quarrels (“It’s their family, let "
them get outs of it themselves. They 
"are in a quarrel today, they will reconcile "
tomorrow”; “If you’re entering someone 
"else’s family, then later you will be "
"looked askance at”, “If you broke in, "
they will reconcile later and you will 
be sure to blame”); such interruptions 
are accepted only in cases of extreme 
physical violence which can lead to 
"serious, irreparable consequences "
(“Depending on the severity of violence 
– if it can hurt health and safety – then 
yes. If it makes a danger for the life”). 
The perception of domestic violence as 
a normal phenomenon determines some 
indifference to the particular facts of violence: 
“It’s not as much the tolerance 
"issue, but rather indifference "
... Most people do not respond 
"at all. For example, while the "
entire apartment building was 
"hearing some cries,  they don’t "
even pay attention... They will 
"not even open the door” (a man, "
Kramatorsk).
These features of the public opinion 
largely reflect the high influence of 
traditional gender stereotypes that 
prevail in the Ukrainian society. The 
image of a “good wife” circulating in 
the mass opinion is still related to such 
"features as patience, ability to find a "
"compromise, “to smooth out the rough "
"edges”, “to not argue with her husband”. "
Other attributes of a good wife include 
"life wisdom, humility, desire to support "
and guide her husband (“a man is the 
"head, and a woman is the neck”), ability "
to be a good hostess.
The participants of discussions 
recognize that generally 
women more often face 
unequal treatment in the 
Ukrainian society. 
Among the main manifestations of such 
prejudice are complications in finding 
a job and discrimination at the labour 
market: 
“If you are trying to get a 
job... they look at your age – 
"if you are young, they think  "
"like: “Hmmm, she will take a "
"maternity leave” (a woman, "
Berdyansk); “If a woman has 
"a small child, then she would  "
often take sick leaves; they do 
"not hire such women” (a woman, "
"Izyum), "
as well as economic vulnerability of 
"women, and unequal distribution of "
household duties: 
“Men are exempt of duties 
which could be divided 
"equally in a family” (a woman, "
Dnipropetrovsk region).

UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINE3.2. ACCESS TO SERVICES OF GBV SURVIVORS
 AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT AT THE LOCAL
 COMMUNITY LEVEL
Discussions about the current system 
of services for GBV survivors revealed 
that respondents do have a general 
idea of specialized services required 
to provide adequate support. Their 
first associations are related to the 
"law enforcement bodies (the police, "
"prosecutors, state security service) and "
"healthcare institutions. However, as "
"discussions pass through, there were "
many conflicting opinions indicating a 
"certain level of respondents’ confusion, "
non-confidence in the need to seek 
help and availability of relevant services. 
The most sceptical assessments 
were expresses towards the law 
"enforcement bodies, both in terms of "
"prevention activities, and regarding the "
prosecution of perpetrators: 
“The police do not react to 
anything... They withdrew 
"a long time ago” (a woman, "
Severodonetsk); “The police 
does not investigate cases of 
"sexual violence. They say - yes, "
"we will investigate, but no one "
would punish the perpetrator 
"later” (a woman, Izyum); “They "
take actions when something 
has already happened. No one 
does prevention efforts...When 
you have wounds and bruises 
you should go and register all of 
them. Then we’ll do something 
"about it” (a woman, Berdyansk)."
The respondents argue that 
the law enforcement agencies 
are trying not to interfere in 
situations related to domestic 
violence: 
“They say – it’s your family 
"business” (a man, Berdyansk). "
The effectiveness of the law 
enforcement response to 
domestic violence is restrained 
also by the absence of a usual 
practice of asking for help in 
"communities: “We are not used to asking”, “Why wash dirty linen "
"in public?” (women, Berdyansk). "
The respondents noted that it is the 
society that often condemns when a 
survivor of domestic violence seeks 
help from law enforcement authorities: 
“People look askance at 
"them”, “They are treated with "
"contempt”, “Some people even "
"mock such women” (women, "
Berdyansk); it is considered 
extremely undesirable to 
provide wide publicity of 
domestic violence because 
people immediately “begin to 
discuss the situation that has 
"arisen, each considers himself a "
"psychologist, an investigator”. "
"As a result, it is the survivor who "
is blamed by people: “Finally 
they say that it’s her fault” 
"(women, Kramatorsk)."
"In the public opinion, there is "
no opportunity to save a good 
family in case of survivor’s 
application to the police; such 
an application will ultimately 
break up marital relations: 
“You can go to the police and 
"leave your family, but it is "
impossible to go to the police 
"and stay in a family” (a woman, "
Severodonetsk).
Another important problem is found 
in the reluctance of witnesses to 
testify in the courts for fear of possible 
"complications, mistrust in transparency "
and impartiality of investigations 
"(“people do not help, because they "
are afraid of consequences”; “instead 
"of  being a witness, you can become "
a culprit yourself”). The respondents 
also spoke about the lack of skilled 
experts in the law enforcement bodies 
who would have the basic skills of 
emergency psychological aid to GBV 
"survivors, mentioned some situations of illegitimate attitude to survivors "
and non-compliance with basic ethical 
norms: 
"“Well, my friend was raped; she "
went to the police immediately 
and wanted to report it. They 
"mocked over her, so she turned "
away and left in tears” (a 
"woman, Kramatorsk)."
The respondents’ attitude to the 
healthcare sector is more tolerant. 
They agree that survivors will receive 
"emergency aid in case of a need, but "
they note that “you will not be treated 
free of charge”. The panellists express 
concerns about the availability of basic 
health services in the conflict-affected 
"regions, as emergency aid cannot reach "
all areas at the moment. The panellists 
agreed that survivors seek medical 
"assistance only in the extreme cases, "
when there is an imminent threat to 
their lives or some risk of irreparable 
"harm, because they are afraid of "
publicity and judgmental attitudes in 
the society (“there is no confidentiality 
of services”).
The respondents’ assessments of the 
"availability of social, psychological and "
legal services for GBV survivors are 
controversial. The panellists are mostly 
not aware about specific organizations 
in their communities and types of 
assistance they can provide: 
“I have not come across 
any information that we 
have a centre working with 
psychological rehabilitation”; 
“There are no announcements 
"of such an organization, neither "
in the media nor on billboards. 
There are no organizations 
promoting their experience in 
dealing with such problems” 
"(men, Berdyansk). People from "
local communities provide a 
rather categorical assessment of 
the efficiency of social services: PUBLIC ATTITUDES TO GBV SURVIVORS APPLYING FOR ASSISTANCE.

UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
"IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINE“There are social services, but "
"they do not work” (a man, "
Kramatorsk).
"According to the respondents, "
GBV survivors most often 
ask their close relatives and 
friends for help: 
"“Most often, they ask close "
persons for support. Those who 
"they can trust”, “They refer to "
those who are more trusted. 
"As shown by practice, the "
authorities are doing nothing” 
"(men, Dnipropetrovsk region)."
They pay attention to the role of church 
and religion in providing moral support to people in situations of psychological 
stress and difficult circumstances: 
“The church is a free 
psychological rehabilitation 
"centre” (a woman, Berdyansk). "
"However, an increase of "
expectations from the media 
"should be noted, as the media "
are perceived as significant 
(and sometimes the only) 
instrument to influence the 
activity of public bodies: 
“The police work only if 
journalists are involved. We call 
"the TV, if needed”(a woman, "
"Dnipropetrovsk region).At large, GBV survivors remain alone "
with their feelings and problems in most 
cases. Women who have a personal 
experience of domestic violence 
remember their feeling of complete 
hopelessness: 
"“I could not go to my mother, "
I could not tell her about 
anything. I could not go to my 
mother-in-law because she did 
not accept me. I had nowhere to 
go at all ... I just wanted to run 
out into the woods and scream. 
And I wanted to take my child 
"somewhere, but where?.. I had "
nowhere to go. I suffered all this 
"time, until my son had grown” (a "
"woman, Kramatorsk).  "
"During the discussions, the "
respondents highlighted some gaps in 
the national legislation related to GBV. 
"In particular, they mentioned a need to "
strengthen criminal liability for violent 
offences: 
“If the abuser does not know 
"that he will be punished, he "
"will continue to rape” (a man, "
"Kramatorsk), "
ineffectiveness of administrative 
sanctions applied to perpetrators 
"of domestic violence, unlawful "
application of financial penalties to 
"the domestic aggressor, because "
they affected the well-being of the 
entire family. Certain provisions of 
the existing legislation were called 
"“illogical”, as these provisions could "
create considerable inconvenience 
to victims. The respondents noted a 
need to enhance the legal awareness 
of citizens that will enable not only the 
"protection of the rights of survivors, "
but also preventing the crimes: 
“We need more information on 
legislation to know that if you 
"commit violence, you will be "
"punished by the law” (a man, "
Kramatorsk).
"Among the priority actions, the "
panellists mentioned strengthening 
the effectiveness of the law 
enforcement agencies to prevent and 
solve crimes: “The credibility of the police 
should be enhanced. If they 
are really afraid of being found 
"out and punished, there will be "
less violence. Now they can do 
"whatever they want, no one "
"is looking for them” (a man, "
Kramatorsk). 
They mention the indispensable 
conditions of changes: to provide 
complete reforming of these 
"structures, to renew the personnel "
and to change general approaches 
to work and interaction with public. 
A lot of expectations are related to 
the new police patrol enjoying a high 
level of public trust. The respondents 
suggest that these services will not 
only respond promptly to the facts of 
"GBV in and outside the family, but also "
carry out some preventive work and 
ensure the adequate public safety in 
the streets: 
“I have a lot of hopes in relation 
to our new police ... That it will 
"work appropriately, deal with "
prevention of criminal offenses 
"in this area ... That, at least, "
"the trained people will come, "
"with new approaches” (a man, "
Berdyansk).
Participants of the focus group 
discussions pay attention to the 
absence of temporary shelters for 
women surviving domestic violence: 
"“As to domestic violence... She is beaten, with a child, at night, "
nobody takes care. Where 
women can go and spend some 
time to resolve the situation? 
There are no such services” (a 
"woman, Kramatorsk). "
They emphasize the need to develop 
a network of crisis centres for GBV 
"victims not only in large cities, but "
"also in small towns, at the level of "
districts and local communities. 
During the discussions about GBV 
"crisis centres, the respondents "
express recommendations to ensure 
"the availability of doctors, lawyers, "
"human rights activists, experts "
providing social and psychological 
services within the permanent staff 
(“A psychologist should be available 
"there, because it is stressful for a "
woman”). Women mentioned the need 
to enable temporary accommodation 
"in these centres, including appropriate "
conditions to stay with children 
(“A rehabilitation centre should be 
"created, providing housing, as well "
as child’s stuff”). It is important 
to provide financial accessibility 
of the service; the majority of the 
respondents argue that the service 
should be provided free of charge: 
"“I might attend a psychologist, "
but it’s too expensive” (a 
"woman, Berdyansk). "

UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINEsuch organizations (“Until there is no 
"governmental funding, the structure "
"will not work”), the need to develop "
some targeted social programs at 
the national and local levels. It is the 
primary responsibility of the state 
and public institutions to develop 
and implement the efforts on GBV 
"preventing and combating; however, a "
need to involve the representatives of 
NGOs and associations of volunteers 
is also emphasized: “The church can 
do a lot”.
Among efficient instruments of 
"assistance, special women’s support "
groups are mentioned (“Groups of 
"self-support, mutual support, such as "
support groups for people with some 
diseases… Such groups can be useful 
"for survivors of violence”, because "
"“If a girl experienced a rape attempt, "
she will support another girl… just by 
"telling where to call, whom apply to”. "
Community representatives 
mentioned the need for further 
development of information policies 
that promote public awareness on the 
"existing services for GBV survivors, "
on types of services for which they 
can apply. Such information should 
be available to the whole population 
and actively promoted in public places 
"and in the media, provided by public "
services on demand. Some possible 
information materials include 
"“distribution of booklets, so "
people somehow knew how 
"to behave in such situations”, "
"“city guides” (women, "
"Berdyansk), “on the Internet, "
this information should 
"emerge in the first place” (men, "
"Dnepropetrovsk region), "
"billboards, newspapers, TV programs. "
The idea to support the information 
hotlines is particularly popular among 
"participants, "
“so that you can call at any 
time” (Berdyansk town); 
it is important that personnel of the 
hotline would guarantee a complete 
confidentiality of appeals 
(“a complete privacy should 
"be provided” (a woman, "
Dnipropetrovsk region)).
"According to their opinion, quite little attention is paid to the issues of "
GBV in the mass media (“there are 
no talks about violence neither on 
"TV, not on radio”). But they believe "
that the media should disseminate 
information on the hotlines and 
organizations providing assistance 
to survivors. Among other possible 
"tools of influence, they mention "
introducing certain controls over the 
content of information on the Internet 
as some provocative materials can be 
"found there often, which may affect "
the personalities of adolescents and 
"young people, their behaviour and "
values.
Respondents noted the 
high importance of family 
and school education 
as components of the 
comprehensive education and 
awareness raising campaigns 
to prevent gender-based 
"violence (men, Kramatorsk "
town). 
They shared the useful experience of 
"school courses on sexual education, "
"ethics and psychology of family life, "
involving students in understanding 
behavioural patterns of marital 
relations.
Discussion participants also 
highlighted the need to develop 
the skills of safe and responsible 
"behaviour among young people, "
to clarify the risks and possible 
consequences of non-compliance with 
basic safety rules: 
"“In my opinion, it is more "
important to train women and 
girls not to find themselves in 
such a situation where they can 
be raped or attacked ... – not 
"to go late at night, not to stay "
alone ... They must realize what 
"kind of a company they join, so "
that they are able to prevent 
violence against themselves” (a 
"man, Kramatorsk)."
"Finally, the panellists "
agreed that the most 
effective approach to 
solving the problem of GBV 
and effectively assisting 
survivors is transformation 
of established stereotypical 
attitudes towards the 
"survivors, elimination of "
their victimization and stigmatization and creating 
non-judgmental attitudes 
towards them in the society:
“The best psychological 
support can be found in a 
different model of public 
attitude towards the victims. 
Some kind of programs on 
television and radio are 
required at the national level 
explaining why women or 
girls are afraid to contact the 
"police, why they are afraid "
"of public opinion, rumours of "
"neighbours, work colleagues... "
It is necessary to educate the 
"society, i.e. to explain that "
survivors of violence have to 
be supported. There is nothing 
"wrong about it, as everyone "
could become a victim of 
violence. The attitude should 
not be changed in case of GBV; 
"in contrast, people should "
become even more caring 
"towards a survivor” (a man, "
Kramatorsk).

of the current trends in GBV in the study regions 
and identification of some general gaps in the public

presented in Annex H.  SECTION 4. 
SITUATION ANALYSIS OF GENDER-
BASED VIOLENCE IN THE CONFLICT-
AFFECTED REGIONS: KEY FINDINGS 
OF IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH 
EXPERTS
The majority of interviewed experts 
"deal with domestic violence, in "
"particular its psychological, physical "
"and economic forms, in accordance "
with their professional duties. 
Practically all experts reported that 
they were actually working on this 
issue; some of them did not overlap 
with other types of violence in their 
"work at all. For example, employees "
of the Centres of Social Services for 
"Family, Children and Youth (CSSFCY) "
are dealing with manifestations of 
"domestic violence only, as their main "
functions are providing assistance 
to families in difficult circumstances 
and families with children. The 
representatives of local authorities 
usually collect information and provide 
referrals of specific cases to the proper services. A wider spectrum of GBV 
"forms and types, including sexual "
"violence, are directly dealt with by "
representatives of the law enforcement 
"and justice, as they are involved "
into investigation of sex-related 
"criminal offenses, health professionals "
and experts of non-governmental 
organizations providing assistance to 
survivors.
"According to the experts, women "
constitute the majority of victims 
(about 80-90% of total survivors); 
"however, they argue that most "
survivors of violence do not seek any 
help and are not ready to share their 
"problem with anyone, in particular "
with regard to sexual violence. There 
are stories of rape victims seeking assistance long after the incident. 
"For example, one of the experts told "
about a young woman who applied 
for psychological support after she 
was raped by her father 14 years ago 
(psychologist of the socio-medical and 
psychological support unit of a youth-
friendly clinic in Pavlograd).
Women mostly come to service 
providers with other issues (e.g. for 
"medical or social support, assistance "
in housing or legal issues); they can 
talk about situations of violence in 
private conversations. According to 
"the experts, the reasons for silence "
are associated with the mentality of 
Ukrainian women who often justify

UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINE(“The morality “he is beating 
"me, so he is loving me” is "
very common [in Ukraine]” 
(a representative of local 
authorities in Lysychansk)); 
they are afraid of publicity and 
"becoming stigmatized, have low "
awareness of the available services 
and see no sense in applying for 
assistance. The experts also emphasize 
that women often do not trust the law 
enforcement bodies and do not expect 
any positive results from such appeals: 
"“Women do not apply, and "
they are doing right. Our 
legislation is very imperf ect...” 
"(a representative of NGO, "
"survivor of domestic violence, "
Lysychansk). 
But some respondents noted an 
increase in filed official complaints 
related to GBV after targeted 
information and education campaigns 
in the regions.
The experts refute the thesis that 
mostly low-income and low-educated 
women are exposed to domestic 
"violence, providing examples of "
representatives of wealthy populations 
"facing such situations as well: “Our society is very archaic, "
so we confront the situations 
where successful women 
are subjected to violence 
and they do not disclose it” 
"(a representative of NGO, "
Mariupol). 
"In the opinion of respondents, "
these groups of women are more 
inclined to conceal such problems  (a 
"representative of NGO, Kharkiv "
"city),  but they are also able to “get out "
of a difficult situation” by themselves. 
"Unlike low-income women, wealthy "
women can purchase or rent another 
apartment and become separated from 
the perpetrator (a representative of 
"NGO, Zaporizhzhya)."
The expert assessments of vulnerability 
of particular categories of women 
are different: most of them cannot 
identify any age-specific characteristics 
of survivors making them more 
vulnerable. There were opinions that 
young women suffer from domestic 
violence more often (because of 
"their being non-experienced), while "
elderly women could face violence by 
sons because of their helplessness. 
Violence most often occurs in families 
"where alcohol abuse is common, and in families with unemployed members "
(one or both spouses). The experts 
confirmed that men also suffer from 
"GBV, but their numbers are rather "
"small, while public perception of "
“masculinity” prevent them from 
complains because of possible blaming 
and stigmatizing in the community 
"(a policeman, Zaporizhzhya; a "
"representative of the CSSFCY, "
Kharkiv).
"With regard to sexual violence, the "
experts do not have a consensus as 
well; they highlight that any woman 
could become a survivor of sexual 
"violence, but the reported situations "
indicate that young women (aged 
20-25) are more vulnerable. Among 
"the risk factors, the experts mentioned "
"the night time, staying alone, alcoholic "
"intoxication of women, availability "
of entertainment centres nearby 
"(a police officer, Dniprorudne). "
"Interestingly, psychologists also point "
out the seasonal dependencies in 
"GBV intensity: in particular, spring "
and autumn are characterized by 
the increased number of appeals 
"caused by GBV, as well as holidays (a "
"psychologist, Zaporizhzhya city).  "
"As to determinants of GBV, the experts "
interviewed mentioned the poor 
economic situation and poverty leading 
"to despair, when people start to abuse "
alcohol and cannot control themselves 
in violent behaviour: 
“Men mostly are fighting and 
drinking” (a representative of 
"NGO, Mariupol). "
One of psychologists mentioned that 
“domestic gender-based 
violence is just a consequence. 
The state pays no attention to 
its determinants. When there 
"is nothing to feed the children, "
"a woman nags her husband, "
and a husband is feeling 
flawed and can abuse his wife. 
Social housing has not been 
"constructed for a long time, "
"so, when several generations "
"live in the same dwelling, it "
"can result in conflicts and, as a consequence, in domestic "
"violence” (a psychologist, "
Zaporizhzhya oblast).
Representatives of the law 
enforcement pay attention to the 
recent changes in sentencing for crime 
offences related to domestic violence; 
"according to the experts, instead of "
"tightening, the new rules have rather "
eased the administrative liability for 
domestic perpetrators. Police officers 
highlighted that police inspectors 
or heads of department were able 
to make a decision on the penalties 
imposed for administrative violations 
before these changes; they also could 
assign administrative detentions at 
the moment of the first application. 
"Presently, policemen can draw up a "
"report, issue an official warning or put "
a perpetrator on the record. Having 
no permission of the household 
"head, policemen have no rights to "
"enter the room, to pick up a victim or her attacker; they are authorized "
only to detain aggressors for no 
more than 3 hours to proceed with 
a protocol (representatives of law 
enforcement bodies in Kharkiv and 
Zaporizhzhya).
The experts also mentioned some 
institutional failings constraining the 
efficiency of GBV prevention. Until 
"recently, the courts usually made "
decisions on penalties in the form of 
a minimum fine (UAH 51 or roughly 
"$2), that obviously did not motivate "
perpetrators to change the models 
"of behaviour. Also, such fines were "
usually paid by the aggressor’s wife 
(the survivor of the violence) from 
"the family budget. Presently, the "
fines are cancelled and replaced with 
community works and administrative 
"arrest; in the experts’ opinion, these "
measures cannot be effective as 
punishment as well.DETERMINANTS OF GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE

UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINEIn the Zaporizhzhya and Dnipropetrovsk 
"regions, most experts have not "
associated the changes in GBV 
prevalence rates with the impact of 
the conflict. They mentioned that the 
registered number of criminal offenses 
has not changed significantly since the 
ATO beginning (representatives of 
"public institutions in Zaporizhzhya, "
"Dnipropetrovsk oblast). In contrast, "
some of them emphasized that stressful 
situations consolidate people and make 
families stronger (a representative 
"of social service provider, Kharkiv). "
They also haven’t traced any links with 
"the influx of displaced people, but some "
experts pointed out psychological non-
acceptance of IDPs in local communities 
"(a representative of CSSFCY, "
Kharkiv).
Some psychologists and police officers 
noted a decrease in the number of 
appeals related to GBV in the regions 
bordering the ATO area. In their 
"view, some aggressors could try not "
to provoke the attention of the law 
"enforcement at this time, perhaps due to "
fears of possible military mobilization (a 
"NGO representative, Zaporizhzhya)."
"In Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts, an increase in crime rates has been "
observed: criminal offenders were far 
from thinking that they can be punished 
by someone in the early and mid-2014. 
“A splash of violence was seen 
clearly: robberies and theft…. 
and increased  number of rapes. 
"In fact, no one knows the exact "
number... A few people could 
refuse a man with a gun in his 
"hands” (a prosecutor, Lysychansk). "
"According to experts, the current "
criminal situation has stabilized in the 
"region, as some marginal population "
groups mostly stay on the other side of 
the demarcation line.
"Regarding the conflict’s impact, the "
interviewed medical workers confirmed 
some non-registered cases of sexual 
violence against girls and women arriving 
from the ATO area. Such cases were 
often identified at times of confidential 
"conversation with gynecologists, "
when displaced women were talking 
about incidents of rapes committed by 
“men in uniform” (an obstetrician-
"gynecologist, Kharkiv)."
A representative of an NGO in Lugansk 
oblast reported on a spate of rapes 
"observed a few months ago. With reference to the medical staff, she "
provided information about 1.5 thousand 
"rapes in the region; however, none of "
these cases were reinforced by official 
confirmation. The NGO representative 
claimed that such incidents were 
"forbidden to be registered, while "
victims were referred to other medical 
departments (such as surgical and 
therapeutic units). The survivors were 
scared and not willing to communicate. 
Similar situations were confirmed by 
a gynecologist who helped women 
from Donbas who survived acts of 
sexual violence perpetrated by “men 
"in uniform”, but did not report these "
incidents to the police or other services 
"(an obstetrician-gynecologist, "
Kharkiv).
Medical experts reported cases where 
women had visible signs of beating 
and injuries of reproductive organs 
but refused to report on the causes of 
"these injuries. However, some health "
care workers stressed that they are not 
obliged to identify the circumstances 
"of injuries, their function is to provide "
the necessary medical care22. Doctors 
of public clinics emphasized that they 
don’t have enough time to identify the THE IMPACT OF THE CONFLICT IN DONETSK AND LUGANSK OBLASTS
ON THE PREVALENCE OF GBV IN THE REGIONSAt any stage of investigation and 
"prosecution, a survivor has the right to "
"abandon the charges, which entails the "
termination of criminal proceedings. 
According to representatives of the 
"law enforcement, situations where "
survivors withdraw their charges as a 
result of financial compensation from 
the offender are rather wide-spread; 
about three quarters of women make 
an official counterstatement requesting 
the withdrawal of the original statement 
(representatives of the law 
"enforcement bodies from Kharkiv, "
"Dniprorudne, Lysychansk)."
"In general, the experts believe that "
problems of GBV have a “chronic” 
character in the Ukraine’s society. The 
repeated appeals for violence are often 
circulating in the so-called “vicious 
"circle”. In other words, when applying "
"to a psychologist or social worker, women usually receive the needed "
"support, but if they are not secured "
by economic factors (could not find 
"a job, rent a separate housing etc.), "
80% of women return home to their 
"aggressors, and everything starts over "
"again  (a representative of NGO, "
Zaporizhzhya).  
“The severity of a criminal 
offense is determined by the 
severity of injuries which are 
"assessed by medical experts, "
and the length of treatment. 
If the treatment lasts 21 days 
"or more, that is the indicator "
of a serious injury. Women 
cannot stay for so long in 
medical institutions because of 
"family reasons, so they refuse "
hospitalization ... there is no one 
"to care for children, and house” "
"(a prosecutor, Zaporizhzhya).A separate problem is the excessive "
complexity of administrative 
procedures. The law enforcement 
agencies must forward information 
on a GBV survivor to the local social 
protection departments within three 
days. Social protection authorities 
must review the case and refer the 
survivor to get the required service 
"during ten days. However, in reality "
the information is often delayed in 
the law enforcement agencies and in 
the social protection departments; 
"sometimes, the materials reach social "
services when the situation is out of 
control and needs no intervention 
(employees of CSSFCY in Kharkiv 
and Zaporizhzhya).  
"22 In the case of sexual violence, there is a protocol of the urgent medical aid for women which provides a list of tests and risks, and is used for recommendations. In "
"particular, women are informed about possible emergency contraception and medicines that can prevent unwanted pregnancy within 72/96 hours. For pregnant "
"women surviving sexual violence, a procedure for interrupting unwanted pregnancies is suggested. If the pregnancy term is less than 6 weeks, medical abortions are "
"done, if the term is more than 6 weeks – the surgery is applied (a gynecologist, Chuhuiv)."

like to. The standards of gynecological 
services have not change d since the 
middle of the last century; the normal 
length for a woman’s examination is 
12 minutes (20 minutes for pregnant 
"women), and includes the entire range "
"of services: medical history, examination, "
"biopsy testing, filling documents "
"(an obstetrician-gynecologist, "
Zaporizhzhya).
Medical professionals emphasize that 
they can only advise survivors to 
contact the police or make a forensic 
examination; they don’t monitor the 
future progress of patients afterwards. 
All doctors interviewed highlighted the 
fact that they do not have the right 
to report their suspicions to the law 
enforcement agencies without the 
"consent of the patient, but they have "
to indicate visual observations in their 
medical files. Among the problems the 
experts noted was the unavailability 
of psychological support in women’s 
"clinics for patients, and for doctors who "
burnout due to emotional stress.
"In general, the experts stressed that the "
procedure for evidencing sex-related 
criminal offense is very complicated. 
Guilt could be proved if a victim reports 
to the police immediately and is able 
to present evidence (to take tests and 
certify the injuries). If some time has 
"passed, the effectiveness of such a "
"report would be very low (a prosecutor, "
"Lysychansk). In this regard, there is "
an urgent problem with conducting 
forensic examination23 in Donetsk and 
"Lugansk oblasts, as many forensic centres with their laboratories stay in "
"the NGCAs (for example, there are only "
14 of 28 laboratories functioning in the 
GCAs of Donetsk oblast); the experts 
have to send the relevant materials to 
laboratories situated in Dnipropetrovsk 
"oblast (a forensic expert, Mariupol)."
"However, the experts also stressed that "
there are rare cases of false information 
on rapes as women try to manipulate 
men for some material purposes. There 
are also cases of false information on 
sexual violence coming from the Donbas 
girls: 
“Parents of a young girls 
contacted the police with 
complaints that she was raped 
by soldiers of the Azov battalion; 
it turned out that she was with 
her friends ... and had not slept 
at home ...” (a representative of 
"NGO, Mariupol)."
The experts cited some other examples 
of manipulation with sexual violence 
during the conflict. Once a female soldier 
of the “Tornado” battalion reported 
being raped by a fellow soldier. During 
"the investigation, it became clear that "
the man was falsely accused in order 
to conceal another crime that took 
"place in the military unit (a prosecutor, "
Lysychansk).
"However, according to the experts, a "
notable increase in GBV is expected in 
"1-2 years, due to the psychological state "
of demobilized soldiers returning to 
"their families. According to the experts, "
people who survived the fighting will not 
"be the same as before, they are going "
"to reassess the values (social service providers, Kharkiv). "
"After experiencing extreme situations, "
men can aggressively take any refusal 
"or denial, believing that other people "
who have not been in similar situations 
have to perform any of their whims (a 
"prosecutor, Zaporizhzhya)."
The experts have already noted some 
single situations of GBV in the families of 
"demobilized soldiers (local authorities, "
Zaporizhzhya). The interviewed medical 
workers confirmed that they had been 
treating women with signs of physical 
violence who privately complained of 
beatings by husbands who had returned 
from the ATO area (an obstetrician-
"gynecologist,  Zaporizhzhya)."
"At the same time, women are also not "
always ready for the return of their “new” 
"men with such psychological disorders, "
so the frequency of conflicts is increasing 
in families. The experts interviewed are 
unanimous that the demobilized military 
personnel need social adaptation and 
crisis counselling; but they emphasize 
that there is no such experience and 
training at the current social service 
providers  (a representative of 
"CSSFCY, Kharkiv).   "
The experts emphasize that there is 
only a national level 24-hour “hotline” 
"on GBV issues. At the regional level, "
some hotlines are available at social 
"service centres and NGOs, but "
they operate only during working 
hours. The 24-hour support for GBV 
survivors is missing at the oblast 
"level. According to the experts, public "
institutions also do not provide 
emergency psychological support; it 
can be obtained only from some non-
governmental organizations (such as 
"NGO “Interaction” in Zaporizhzhya, that is the association of psychologists and "
psychiatrists).
There are practically  no safe shelters 
for women surviving GBV; for many 
"years, there has been no crisis centre "
in Kharkiv oblast (there are only five 
other regions with no crisis centres 
"in Ukraine); obviously, the absence "
of shelters limits the effectiveness of 
providing protection to survivors (a 
"social service provider, Kharkiv)."
The experts from Kharkiv oblast noted EXPERT ASSESSMENT OF THE MAIN PROBLEMS IN THE FIELD OF GBV PREVENTION

UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINEAll experts confirmed that they adhere to confidentiality guidelines following the 
Law of Ukraine “On Personal Data Protection”.
The experts interviewed reported that 
there are special ways for reporting 
cases of GBV –  either through special 
documents (e.g. Form 1-HC “Report 
on the situation with combating 
domestic violence” that indicates 
"the registered appeals, protocols, registered cases and official "
warnings) or as a separate indicator 
in an aggregated table. All involved 
organizations collect some pieces 
"of information on GBV, but there is "
no unified database accessible to all 
involved agencies.
The experts from Zaporizhzhya and 
Dnipropetrovsk oblasts emphasized 
the cohesive work of the law 
"enforcement agencies, CSSFCYs, the "
local authorities and some NGOs (such 
as NGO “Interaction” in Zaporizhzhya 
oblast) in the regions. There are 
memoranda on cooperation between 
organizations involved in activities on 
combating GBV.
"At the time of the study, there was no "
established cooperation between the 
law enforcement agencies and centres 
of social services in Kharkiv oblast (a 
"representative of CSSFCY, Kharkiv); "
social workers were also dissatisfied 
with the work of the law enforcement: 
“Representatives of the 
law enforcement  do not 
pay attention to appeals 
"regarding domestic violence, "
they don’t possess the skills 
of primary counselling like 
the social services... there is 
no information exchange” (a 
"representative of CSSFCY, "
Mariupol); “The police try not to 
"interfere ... they say, this is your "
"business, you will deal with it "
by yourself” (a representative of 
"CSSFCY, Kharkiv).Representatives of CSSFCYs reported "
that even knowing about cases 
"of violence, they cannot respond "
adequately: 
“Until there is a criminal 
"proceeding initiated, the police "
does not provide the information 
on such situations. The facts 
can be revealed at the time of 
"inspection of a family, we can "
get information from neighbours 
"or teachers. However, until this "
appeal has not gone through the 
"procedure in the departments, "
we have no right to interfere” 
"(a representative of CSSFCY, "
Kharkiv).
The system of coordination and 
cooperation is not working in Donbas 
due to political instability; there are 
"no crisis programs, no coordination of "
experts in the regions: 
"“Presently, the authorities "
consciously are not working 
"well in Lysychansk, to show the "
"negative side of Kyiv authorities, "
of Ukraine’s  authorities...” 
(a representative of Military 
and Civil Administration in 
Lysychansk). “The war has left 
"its marks, so you need to start "
"it all over again” (a police officer, "
Lysychansk). CONFIDENTIALITY

women’s support groups and self-
support groups for survivors of GBV 
"(a representative of CSSFCY, Kharkiv). "
The regional NGOs are mainly engaged 
into providing information services 
and individual support to survivors. 
"In general, there are no NGOs dealing "
with GBV in many small towns and 
"district centres of Ukraine (Lysychansk, "
"Chuhuiv, Vasilevka, Dniprorudne), not "
to mention rural areas.A positive sign is seen by the experts in 
the creation of secondary legal support 
outlets providing advice and assistance 
to the vulnerable people.
Safety planning for witnesses and 
survivors is also non-developed (there 
"is no funding, the programs are not "
operating); people refuse to testify in 
courts and try to conceal the facts of 
"violence (a prosecutor, Lysychansk)."
59 58
UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINEThe experts from public institutions 
"reported regular trainings, seminars, "
information programs on GBV 
prevention and counteraction. Medical 
workers spoke about PAC courses – 
the pre-accreditation cycles carried out 
once a year to improve qualifications; 
in the framework of these cycles 
information on supporting GBV 
"survivors is also provided (a doctor, "
Chuhuiv). 
"However, the experts from Donetsk and "
Lugansk oblasts indicated that they 
hadn’t had any training or retraining due to the difficult situation in their 
regions.
The representatives of CSSFCYs 
informed that there are psychologists 
available who have the proper training 
"to support GBV survivors, including "
"survivors of sexual violence, at the "
"centres. However, the representatives "
of NGOs stressed that they lack 
training and professional development 
"programs, they are not invited as "
listeners to such trainings and have to 
seek any information by themselves (a 
"NGO representative, Zaporizhzhya)."
The representatives of all public 
institutions complained of the lack of 
skilled specialists; they also mentioned 
low wages of public servants as 
a problem preventing the care 
providers from retaining qualified 
"workforce. For example, a number "
of agencies at the district level are 
staffed with specialists only by one 
third of the need (including the law 
"enforcement agencies, departments "
"of social protection, centres of social "
services). The representatives of all 
CSSFCYs reported the staffing is just 
catastrophic after the elimination of 
"the institution of social work specialists, "
while the workload has increased and 
the experts have no time to cover the 
entire range of issues and provide 
comprehensive services to all people 
"in need. In addition to the “ministerial” tasks, they need to conduct field "
"trips, which is very difficult given "
the lack of transport and sufficient 
"number of specialists. In rural areas, "
there are practically no social services 
(representatives of CSSFCY in 
"Zaporizhia, Kharkiv, Pavlograd, "
Chuhuiv).  
The experts also emphasize the 
"lack of staff with proper training, "
"in particular at the district level, "
"the lack of psychologists, social "
"workers etc. (Pavlograd, Chuhuiv, "
Dnipropetrovsk). After the liquidation 
"of departments of family and children, "
their functions were transferred to 
"other departments, and the experts do "
not always have appropriate education 
"and experience, they have to study the "
problems on their own.  AWARENESS RATE AND

PREVENTION
STAFFING
In spite of involvement of the 
interviewed experts into various 
"institutional sectors, all of them "
emphasize the common objectives 
and priorities to be taken into account 
when developing the policies to 
prevent and combat GBV. Most 
of them stressed that Ukraine has 
not developed the institution of 
"psychological support, there is no "
culture of applying to psychologists in 
"difficult situations, there is no proper "
system of education and training of young people into adulthood.
Most respondents agree on the 
need to strengthen the penalties for 
offenders of violence. The experts 
believe that the new CPC is quite 
"humane. They noted, if there were "
penalties that would sentence at least 
"one year of conditional imprisonment, "
“they would have behaved differently”. 
Some experts regard that introduction 
of community works would have 
"a positive impact on rapists, while other respondents argue that such "
penalty is not sufficient to prevent and 
combat GBV: 
“Correctional programs do 
not operate in rural areas 
"at all, the state does not "
finance the programs... The 
"penalty was abolished, leaving "
only the public works and 
"administrative detention, which "
do not solve the problem” (a 
"lawyer, representative of NGO, "
Dnipropetrovsk).ASSESSMENT OF NEEDS

59 58
UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINEThe respondents also noted the lack 
of services to implement correctional 
programs; there are no trained 
"professionals, while offenders are "
"reluctant to attend such programs, and "
there are no compulsory instruments 
of their rehabilitation. To raise the 
efficiency of support in the crisis 
"centres, the work with aggressors "
should be conducted in the presence 
of police officers (a representative 
"of CSSFCY, Mariupol).  Moreover, "
the experts stressed the gaps in 
the regulatory framework that 
stipulates the mandatory character 
"of corrective programs, but does not "
specify the respective authorities 
responsible. The experts proposed to 
assign the responsibility for making 
offenders attending such programs 
to the law enforcement agencies 
"(representatives of CSSFCY, "
"Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhya). "
"“Ideally, some budgets should "
be allocated to involve 
professionals in correctional 
"programs, as psycho-"
correction is provided by senior 
psychologists” (a representative 
"of CSSFCY, Zaporizhzhya)."
The experts believe that the current 
system makes it difficult to process 
"the evidence of violence, including "
sexual violence. It is difficult to confirm 
"the fact of sexual violence, as, besides "
"the required forensic expertise, some "
witnesses of violence should testify 
to provide evidence. It is particularly 
difficult to confirm sexual violence 
committed by husbands against their 
"wives (a doctor, Chuhuiv)."
"In the criminal proceedings, there is "
an opportunity of agreement between 
the survivor and the perpetrator. 
There are several forms of court 
verdict commutation for a person who 
admitted the offense and cooperates 
with the law enforcement bodies. 
"During sentencing, the preferences "
of survivors are considered and if 
a survivor requires a more severe 
"sentence, the court takes her opinion "
"into account (a judge, Vasylivka). The "
new CPC prohibits detaining a suspect 
in case of domestic violence. The 
experts have reported a case where 
inspectors once have calmed down 
an aggressor but then had to come back in just 2 hours in response to the 
repeated call (a law enforcement 
"officer, Lysychansk)."
Ukraine has a practice of withdrawing 
women and children from their 
households in case of domestic 
violence. Despite the fact that women 
"are the victims and suffer, it is exactly "
them who have to change their 
"usual way of life, transfer children to "
"another school, sacrifice their work "
"sometimes, while the abusers just stay "
at home having no annoyance and 
enjoying even a more comfortable 
situation. The experts declare the 
need to isolate abusers from survivors 
through the legislation. According 
"to the international experience, it "
is advisable to create specialized 
centres to temporarily host male 
abusers and put them through a 
compulsory correctional program 
(representatives of CSSFCY and 
"NGOs, Zaporizhzhya, Kharkiv)."
The experts stressed the need to 
enhance the public awareness on 
"GBV. For this purpose, it is advisable "
to simplify remembering important 
information (e.g. GBV hotline numbers 
"should be short and easily memorable), "
to spread information through handy 
"means in public places, so that anyone "
could easily get information anywhere 
(e.g. at post offices or shops). 
Awareness creation campaigns should 
be targeted at specific audiences 
(different approaches have to be 
"applied to parents, men and women) to "
"ensure that “men, as well as women, "
understand that they are protected 
"and can seek help, and it will not be "
seen by society as a weakness” (a 
"representative of CSSFCY, Kharkiv)."
Another suggestion is to improve the 
procedures and speed up the exchange 
of information between the authorities 
involved: 
“If information [of violence] 
would come to the centre [of 
"social services], not to the "
"department, then the response "
"would be much quicker; also, "
we are perceived not as 
"officials, while the departments "
are taken as officials” (a 
"representative of CSSFCY, "
Kharkiv). Hence it is proposed to route GBV 
case information flow from the law 
enforcement agencies to both the 
departments of social protection and 
centres of social services.
The ban on placing social 
advertisement on outdoor carriers 
without the consent of local authorities 
makes reaching out with public 
information more cumbersome. 
"Moreover, as nearly all street billboards "
and “city light” ad installations are 
"privately owned, placing social ads "
there would cost money. Due to 
"constrained funding, social services "
are not financially capable to place any 
socially important information there on 
the commercial basis. A solution could 
be found in signing social responsibility 
agreements between the centres of 
social services and advertisement 
carrier owners for using part of the 
carriers to deliver socially important 
messages from time to time (free 
of charge or at the expense of the 
local budgets) (a representative of 
"CSSFCY, Kharkiv)."
Staff of centres of social services 
believe that the recent abolishment of 
the institution of social work specialists 
has become an insurmountable barrier 
to delivering good quality social care to 
those in need: 
“Social work professionals 
"were working in each village, "
they were the emergency aid” 
"(a representative of CSSFCY, "
Kharkiv). 
All social services personnel stressed 
that the abolishment of this structure 
had the disastrous consequences. At 
"the district level, there are no trained "
"specialists in social work at all, "
"“no money, no transportation "
"means, but you still must "
implement the programs” 
"(representatives of CSSFCY, "
"Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhya). "
"Along with that, they believe that "
the newly established bureaucratic 
procedures are detrimental to 
employees of social services centres. 
Replacing the previously used 
"inspection forms, a new reporting form "
“Child and family needs assessment” 
"was adopted, which contains a "
61 60
UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINElot of redundant information and 
requires more time for completion; 
"in the experts’ opinion, switching to "
this new form reduces the time to 
be spent working directly with the 
"families (representatives of CSSFCY, "
"Lysychansk, Pavlograd)."
For social work professionals who daily 
"face extremely complicated situations, "
there is a need for qualified supervisors 
who can deal with professional 
burnout. A special state psychological 
service is needed to provide such 
"services to social, medical and law "
enforcement workers facing intense 
"stress (representatives of CSSFCY, "
"Kharkov, Zaporizhzhya)."
"As already mentioned, there is an "
urgent problem of high staff turnover 
"at social services. Due to low wages, "
many young professionals leave after 
working for a short period of time and 
"look for better paid jobs; as a result, "
it is impossible to retain experienced 
professionals and effectively develop 
the system of social services. To enhance activity coordination and 
"build professional links, it is necessary "
to conduct joint seminars on GBV 
"prevention, to invite specialists from all "
institutional sectors dealing with GBV 
"issues (representatives of CSSFCY, "
Kharkiv) .
It is also necessary to foster a culture 
of psychological support. Many 
people believe that they do not need 
psychological help just because “they 
"are not sick”. Therefore, there is a need "
to educate people about various forms 
"of violence, their possible psychological "
"sequelae and how to identify them, "
and how to apply for help from a 
psychologist when needed. Special 
programs are needed for women 
to help raise their self-esteem and 
understand their self-sufficiency. If a 
"woman endured the abuse once, it just "
provokes the abuser for more violence 
"(a police officer, Lysychansk)."
The experts emphasize that people’s 
behavioural models all depend on the 
climate in families: “Gender stereotypes are passed 
from an older generation 
on to a younger generation. 
There is a common model of 
a family: an aggressive father 
and an enduring mother. The 
stereotypes get imprinted in 
education: boys must fight 
"back, while girls have to "
endure... There is no training in 
"terms of gender education, no "
educational model of a family” 
"(a lawyer, representative of "
"NGO, Dnipropetrovsk).  "

UKRAINIAN CENTRE  
FOR SOCIAL REFORMSGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE  
IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINEIt could be argued that for many 
years Ukraine has been failing to 
implement a systematic approach 
to solving socioeconomic issues 
that this way or another influence 
domestic and gender-based violence 
"(including low living standards, high "
"rates of poverty and unemployment, "
inefficient social protection of 
"certain categories of the population, "
non-organized leisure of children 
"and youth, archaic social norms etc.)."
"In addition, during 2014-2015, "
Ukraine has run the completely 
new social risks imposed mostly 
"on IDPs, residents of the ATO "
area and the “grey zone” along 
"the demarcation line, participants "
"of the ATO, demobilized military "
personnel and their families. At the 
background of the military conflict 
"in Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts, "
the risks of conflicts and aggression 
have grown in the society. Among 
the main factors of such growth are 
changes in the usual way of life of 
"many families, high emotional and "
psychological dependence of people 
"on the situation in the ATO area, "
irregular circulation of unregistered military arms throughout the 
"country, aggravated crime situation "
in the regions bordering the 
"conflict zone, increased intensity "
"of migratory movements, broken "
rule of law and access to justice in 
"the NGCAs, distorted ethical norms "
"and values due to atrocities of war, "
severed family ties due to ideological 
"disagreements, and manifestations "
of post-traumatic syndrome among 
the demobilized soldiers. At the 
"national level, an adequate and "
comprehensive assessment of the 
"new social risks is still lacking, no "
effective response mechanisms 
have been yet developed – in 
"particular, in terms of a broader use "
of administrative resources (e.g. 
coordination of civilian and military 
"authorities), appropriate government "
support of the civil society initiatives 
"(e.g. volunteering), and timely "
response to the needs of specific 
population groups.  CONCLUSIONS 
AND POLICY 
RECOMMENDATIONS
The current national institutional environment for preventing and combating domestic violence 
and gender-based violence has basic components necessary to make the response mechanism 
"functional. Also there is a legislatively determined system of objectives, conditions, activities and "
"tools for each institutional sector involved in GBV response, as well as a system of controls by "
public prosecution and parliamentary monitoring in this area.
"HOWEVER, THE STUDY "
HAS REVEALED THAT:
•	Selected procedures and 
response activities related 
"to violence identification, "
case management 
and prevention need 
improvement;
•	The current institutional 
model of preventing 
and combating violence 
requires significant 
redesigning to be able 
to manage the social 
consequences of the 
antiterrorist operation 
(ATO).

•	unwillingness of law enforcement officers to intervene 
in situations of domestic violence (because of its 
perceived intrafamilial nature);

Reducing the vulnerability risks for survivors and potential 
victims could be set as the main goal when establishing 
"institutional mechanisms of GBV response. However, "
the gravity of the socioeconomic situation in Ukraine 
predetermines the possibility of unpredictable growth of 
"such vulnerability risks, hence the need for new approaches "
to policy development in this field.
Along with further improvement of the national legislative 
"framework, including the ratification of the Istanbul "
"Convention (2011)27 by the Parliament of Ukraine, it is "
advisable to upgrade the contents of selected components 
of the national GBV response machinery to better address 
"the needs of the emerging target groups of the policy, "
"including IDPs, residents of the ATO areas and areas along the demarcation line, ATO participants, demobilized soldiers "
and their families.
"In our view, particular attention should be paid to "
improving the effectiveness of preventive mechanisms and 
mechanisms of support; the latter must be supplemented 
by measures to overcome possible social exclusion of DV 
and GBV survivors. Considering the variety of actors already 
involved into GBV response and new institutions that might 
"get on-board (the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, military "
"prosecution offices, military and civil administrations, patrol "
"police), as well as the diversity of their mandates, there is a "
"definite need for improving coordination of their activities, "
especially in working with target populations and situation 
monitoring.PROPOSALS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF UKRAINE
The improved policies on DV and GBV should focus on 
both the traditional and innovative sources and channels 
"of public communications to deliver information about institutions and services available for help. This information should be able to reach everyone and cover all service providers and vulnerable groups (including the elderly). The good practice of disseminating visual public service announcements, posters and other printed materials (booklets, postcards, calendars etc.) should be expanded, as well as the practice of national social campaigns and mass events on GBV prevention and response. The increasing role of the mass media in shaping the public discourse should be harnessed to reinforce the communications strategy and get messages delivered to every home. Of special importance is collaboration with television and radio stations that remain the main source of information for many people, especially in rural and remote areas. However, it should be noted that access to the mass media may be limited in selected areas affected by the military conflict."
Scarcity of reliable information on GBV prevalence and 
"features, inherent limitations of information sources that collect data on the number of registered offenses, applications of survivors for various services, results of administrative or criminal proceedings and court verdicts, willingness to make policy actions grounded on solid evidence altogether testify for the need to establish and operationalize an integrated inter-agency database to manage and share comprehensive information on GBV cases.

   Report of the Independent International Commission of 
Inquiry on Ukraine  
 
 
 
 Summary  
" In the present report, the Independent Internat ional Commission of Inquiry on "
Ukraine refers to findings about events during late February and March 2022 in the 
"four provinces of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy, as requested by the Human "
Rights Council in its resolution S-34/1 . 
" During this first phase of its investigations, the Commission has found that war "
crimes and violations of human rights and international humanitarian law have been 
committed in Ukraine since 24 February 2022. Russian armed forces are responsible 
for the va st majority of the violations identified.  
 Ukrainian forces have also committed international humanitarian law violations 
"in some cases, including two incidents that qualify as war crimes.  "
" The Commission, composed of three experts, applies a “reasonabl e grounds to "
"conclude” standard of proof in reaching its conclusions, based on a body of verified "
information.  
 The relentless use of explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated 
areas has killed and injured scores of civilians and devastated ent ire neighbourhoods. 
"The Commission documented indiscriminate attacks using cluster munitions, "
unguided rockets and air strikes in the context of attempts by Russian armed forces 
to capture towns and smaller settlements.  
 These weapon systems are highly li kely to have indiscriminate effects and cause 
"significant harm to civilians. Indeed, most of the verified deaths since the outset of "
"the hostilities have been caused by these weapons. Residential buildings, schools and "
"hospitals, among other parts of the c ivilian infrastructure, have been damaged or destroyed . "
 The Commission also found that Russian armed forces had shot at civilians 
"attempting to flee, and that during the conduct of hostilities, the parties had deployed "
"their military assets and troops in  ways that can endanger civilians, in contravention "
of international humanitarian law.  
" Furthermore, the Commission documented patterns of summary executions, "
"unlawful confinement, torture, ill -treatment,  and rape and other sexual violence "
committed in areas occupied by Russian armed forces across the four provinces on 
"which it focused. People have been detained, some have been unlawfully deported to "
"the Russian Federation, and many are still reported missing. Sexual violence has "
"affected vi ctims of all ages. Victims, including children, were sometimes forced to "
witness the crimes.  
 Children have become the victims of the full spectrum of violations investigated 
"by the Commission, including indiscriminate attacks, torture and rape, suffering  the "
predictable psychological consequences.  
 These violations continue to have a devastating effect on victims and survivors. 
"Significantly, victims emphasized the essential role of justice and accountability. In "
"this regard, the Commission recommends en hanced coordination of international and "
national accountability efforts to improve effectiveness and prevent harm to victims 
"and witnesses. The Commission, consistent with its mandate, will seek to contribute "
to the identification of those responsible.

  I. Introduction  
 
 
1. The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine submits 
herewith its first report to the General Assembly on the progress of its work and 
preliminary findings.  
"2. In its resolution 49/1  of 4 March 2022, the Human Rights Council decided to "
urgently establish an independent international commission of inquiry to investigate 
all alleged violations and abuses of human rights and violatio ns of international 
humanitarian law and related crimes in the context of the aggression against Ukraine 
by the Russian Federation. The Council mandated the Commission to establish the 
"facts, circumstances and root causes of such violations, and, where pos sible, to "
"identify those responsible, as well as to make recommendations, in particular on "
accountability measures.  
"3. The Human Rights Council called upon the Commission to collect, consolidate "
"and analyse evidence, including through field engagement and in cooperation with "
"judicial and other entities, and to provide it with an oral update at its fifty -first session "
and a comprehensive written report at its fifty -second session and  to submit a report 
to the General Assembly at its seventy -seventh session.  
"4. On 30 March 2022, the President of the Human Rights Council announced the "
"appointment of Erik Møse (Norway), Jasminka Džumhur (Bosnia and Herzegovina) "
and Pablo de Greiff (Colombia) to serve as the three independent members of the 
"Commission, with Mr. M øse serving as Chair.  "
"5. In its resolution S-34/1  of 12 May 2022, on the deteriorating human rights "
"situation in Ukraine, the Council further requested the Commission to conduct an "
"inquiry to address t he events in the areas of the provinces of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv "
"and Sumy  in late February and in March 2022, including their gender dimension, with "
"a view to holding those responsible to account, and to include its findings in its report "
to the Council . 
 
 
 II. Methods of work  
 
 
 A.  Mandate and methodology of the Commission  
 
 
6. The Commission considers all violations and abuses of human rights and 
violations of international humanitarian law and related crimes committed in Ukraine 
"within its internati onally recognized borders, as well as outside its territory, provided "
such events occurred in the context of the aggression against Ukraine by the Russian 
"Federation. Guided by the principles of independence, impartiality, objectivity and "
"integrity, the Co mmission examines allegations of violations regardless of the identity "
or nationality of the alleged responsible individual or entity. In addition to making 
recommendations regarding criminal accountability and identifying responsible 
"individuals or entiti es where possible, the Commission will make recommendations "
about other dimensions of accountability to which victims have rights.  
"7. The Commission adopts a victim -centred approach in all aspects of its work, "
"strictly respecting the “do no harm” principl e, including in relation to guarantees "
regarding the confidentiality of the information received and the protection of victims 
and witnesses.  
8. Given the large number of allegations of violations and abuses of human rights 
"and violations of international  humanitarian law falling under its mandate, the limited "
"resources and time available and the challenges in gaining access to certain victims, "
"witnesses and areas affected by the hostilities, the Commission cannot possibly "
A/77/533   
 
22-23590  4/20 
 examine all reported incidents. I t focuses on incidents selected based on the gravity 
"of the allegations, their significance in demonstrating patterns of alleged violations, "
"the access to victims, witnesses and supporting documentation, and the  geographic "
locations of the incidents. Parti cular consideration is given to the gender dimensions 
"of violations and their impact on women, children and people affected by "
intersectional inequalities.  
"9. The findings rely primarily on first -hand information, including interviews with "
witnesses and vi ctims of alleged violations and abuses. The Commission seeks further 
"corroboration from available primary and secondary sources from States, United "
"Nations agencies, funds and programmes, civil society organizations, media and other "
relevant actors. It als o issued a call for submission of information and documentation 
relevant to its mandate.  
10. Consistent with the standard of proof followed by most international 
"commissions of inquiry, the Commission includes findings in its report when, based "
"on a body o f verified information, an objective and ordinary prudent observer would "
have reasonable grounds to conclude that the facts took place as described. It draws 
legal conclusions when there are reasonable grounds to conclude that the facts meet 
"all the elemen ts of a violation or abuse and, where possible, that an individual or "
entity is responsible for the violation or abuse.  
"11. At the time of submission of the present report, the Commission had travelled "
"to Ukraine five times and visited 27 cities, towns an d settlements to conduct its "
inquiry into the events. The team collected and preserved evidence of violations and 
related crimes.  
"12. In preparing the report, the Commission relied on 191 interviews with 110 "
"women and 81 men, conducted in person and remote ly, inspected sites of destruction, "
"graves, places of detention and torture, as well as weapon remnants, and consulted a "
"large number of documents and reports. It met with Government authorities, "
"international organizations, civil society and other relevan t stakeholders.  "
13. The Commission expresses its gratitude to those who shared their – often -
"traumatic – experiences and appreciates the assistance provided by Governments, "
"United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, and civil society organizations.  "
 
 
 B.  Legal framework  
 
 
"14. Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 49/1 , international human rights "
"law, international humanitarian law and international criminal law constitute the laws "
applicable to the mandate of the Commission.  
"15. As for international human rights law, both Ukraine and the Russian Federation "
are party to seven of the nine core human rights instruments.1 Ukraine is also party to 
"another core human rights treaty, namely, the Con vention for the Protection of All "
Persons from Enforced Disappearance. Both States have ratified the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children 
in armed conflict.  
__________________  
" 1  The seven human rights instruments are: the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, "
Inhuman or D egrading Treatment or Punishment; the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights; the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women; the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discriminatio n; 
"the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the Convention on the "
Rights of the Child; and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  
 A/77/533  
 
5/20 22-23590  
" 16. With regard to international humanitar ian law, both Ukraine and the Russian "
"Federation are party to, among others, the four Geneva Conventions of 1949.2 "
"Ukraine acceded to Additional Protocols I, II and III of the Geneva Conventions, "
while the Russian Federation acceded to Additional Protocol s I and II and signed 
"Additional Protocol III. Along with treaty law, the Commission will apply customary "
international humanitarian law. Relevant provisions and rules of international 
humanitarian law are also binding upon non -State actors that may be inv olved in the 
conflict.  
"17. The situation in Ukraine is an international armed conflict, pursuant to common "
"article 2 of the four Geneva Conventions, owing to the armed hostilities existing "
"between the two States, through their respective armed forces or ot her actors acting "
on their behalf.  
"18. In terms of international criminal law, the Commission will apply the relevant "
international treaties and customary international law. Neither Ukraine nor the 
Russian Federation are parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal 
"Court. However, the Court has jurisdiction in Ukraine, pursuant to two declarations "
lodged by Ukraine and referrals by States parties to the Rome Statute.3 The Rome 
Statute provides detailed elements for some of the alleged crimes. The ratification of 
"the Statute by a majority of the States Members of the United Nations reflects, on the "
"whole, the definition of these crimes under customary international law.4 Where the "
"Court is found to lack jurisdiction, the Commission will apply t he elements of crimes "
"within the Rome Statute, as long as they reflect customary international law.  "
 
 
 C.  Cooperation and coordination  
 
 
"19. In accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 49/1 , the  Commission "
expects to receive full cooperation from a broad range of actors in the course of its 
investigations. It has sought cooperation and dialogue with the Governments of 
"Ukraine and the Russian Federation to, among other things, secure access to the  areas "
where it conducts its investigations and to obtain responses regarding particular 
aspects of its inquiry. It provided the Governments of both States with advance copies 
of the preliminary findings.  
20. The Commission appreciates the cooperation exte nded by the Government of 
Ukraine. It regrets that attempts to establish meaningful communication with 
authorities of the Russian Federation have been unsuccessful and will persist in its 
efforts in this regard.  
21. The work of the Commission builds on tha t of the human rights monitoring 
mission in Ukraine and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
"Human Rights (OHCHR). To ensure its independence and impartiality, the "
Commission follows well -established processes for such cooperation and con ducts its 
own investigations independently and separately from any United Nations or other 
entity.

" 22. In the view of the Commission, sound coordination between entities engaged in "
the documentation of the violations and crimes in Ukraine is key to ensurin g 
efficiency and avoiding duplication of efforts and the retraumatization of victims and 
witnesses. It has therefore engaged with the Office of the Prosecutor of the  
"International Criminal Court, as well as with other relevant international and national "
entities.  
 
 
 D.  Accountability and sharing of information and evidence  
 
 
23. Information and documentation collected by the Commission will be shared 
"with competent investigative, prosecutorial and judicial authorities to facilitate and "
"expedite criminal proceedings, under conditions of fairness, due process, "
non-applicability of the death penalty and compliance with the relevant human rights 
standards. The consent of witnesses and other interlocutors for external uses of the 
information is fundam ental in handling such requests. The Commission uses 
protocols for informed consent from the victims and witnesses during its 
"investigations. In each case, risks to victims, witnesses or information providers and "
respect for confidentiality is considered.  
 
 
 III. Events since 24 February 2022  
 
 
 A.  Background  
 
 
"24. On 24 February 2022, the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, "
disclosed the launching of a “special military operation” to “seek the demilitarization 
"and de -Nazification” of Ukra ine.5 On the same date, Russian armed forces6 crossed "
"various border points into Ukraine, including from Belarus, and launched attacks by "
"land, air and sea. During the preceding days, President Putin had recognized the "
"provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk, i n eastern Ukraine, as independent republics. The "
Federation Council of Russia subsequently approved the military operation in 
Ukraine.  
25. Calls for an immediate cessation of the hostilities followed. After a draft 
resolution demanding that the Russian Fed eration cease its use of force against 
Ukraine failed to pass in the Security Council owing to a veto by the Russian 
"Federation, the General Assembly, in its resolution ES-11/1 of 2 March 2022, "
demanded t hat the Russian Federation immediately cease its use of force against 
"Ukraine and immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military "
"forces from the territory of Ukraine. In its resolution 49/1  of 4 March 2022, the "
Human Rights Council stressed the urgent need for the Russian Federation to 
"immediately cease its military hostilities against Ukraine. On 16 March 2022, the "
International Court of Justice ordered the Russian Federation to  suspend the military 
"operations.7 States and provincial bodies condemned the military operation, called for "
its cessation and imposed far -reaching economic sanctions and other measures. Direct 
and indirect negotiation attempts have not yielded success thus far.

7/20 22-23590  
  B.  Military operations  
 
 
26. The Ukrainian authorities declared martial law and ordered a general 
mobilization. Military strikes using explosive weapons had been launched by armed 
"forces of the Russian Federation across Ukraine, includ ing in areas situated far from "
"the front lines, causing significant civilian casualties and large -scale destruction of "
residential buildings and critical infrastructure.  
"27. On the northern front, on 24 February 2022, Russian armed forces advanced "
towards  Kyiv and captured key areas to the north and west of the city. They 
"surrounded Chernihiv and subjected the city to heavy airstrikes and artillery fire, "
which severed it from essential supply and evacuation routes.  
"28. By the end of March 2022, the offensi ve on Kyiv had stalled. As Russian armed "
"forces withdrew from localities that they had occupied temporarily, dozens of dead "
"people and large -scale destruction were uncovered. Following these reports, the "
"General Assembly adopted resolution ES-11/3, in which it called for the Russian "
Federation to be suspended from the Human Rights Council.  
"29. In north -eastern Ukraine, the cities of Kharkiv and Sumy quickly became the "
scenes of heavy urban warfare. Shellin g pounded residential and other key buildings 
"and led to large -scale destruction. By April 2022, Russian armed forces had "
"withdrawn from the Sumy area. In May 2022, a Ukrainian counter -offensive forced "
"Russian armed forces to retreat from Kharkiv. Neverthe less, artillery strikes on the "
city of Kharkiv and localities nearby continued in the next phase of the operations.  
"30. In southern Ukraine, Russian armed forces attacked the provinces of Kherson, "
Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhia and occupied several cities and l ocalities. On 26 February 
"2022, Russian armed forces launched an offensive on Mariupol. The city suffered "
"from constant shelling, which led to large -scale destruction. For weeks, heavy "
fighting hampered repeated efforts to evacuate civilians and curtailed the access of 
"inhabitants to basic necessities. Tens of thousands of civilians fled. On 20 May 2022, "
the Russian Federation declared that it had gained full control of the city.  
"31. Meanwhile, on 19 April 2022, a second phase of the war began. This phase "
concentrated mainly on the Donetsk and Luhansk Provinces and on the southern front. 
"There was intense, weeks -long fighting in and around the city of Sievierodonetsk, "
"until its eventual capture by Russian armed forces in June, and in Zaporizhzhia "
"Prov ince. Fighting also raged in Kharkiv Province until September 2022, when "
"Ukrainian armed forces,8 in a counter -offensive, recovered large swaths of territory.  "
32. The conduct of military operations from within or around the Chernobyl and 
Zaporizhzhia nucl ear plants and the threat by the Russian Federation of use of its 
nuclear capabilities became a major concern for the international community.  
 
 
 C.  Impact on civilians  
 
 
"33. Civilian casualties continue to grow. As at 17 October 2022, OHCHR had "
"recorded 6,306 people killed and 9,602 wounded in all of Ukraine since 24 February "
"2022. From 24 February to 31 March 2022, in the four provinces under the "
"Commission’s investigation, 1,237 civilians, including 112 children, were killed, "
according to OHCHR. Actual figures are likely to be much higher. Months of fighting 
"have gravely impacted the country’s infrastructure, with thousands of residential "
"buildings, as well as medical and education facilities, destroyed or severely damaged. "

combatants who are identified as such or as directly affiliated with the Ukrainian armed forces.  
A/77/533   
 
22-23590  8/20 
" As of mid -October 2022, millio ns had lost homes and livelihoods, and were forced to "
flee. Over 7 million people from Ukraine have sought refuge abroad and over 
"6 million are internally displaced. In most of the affected areas within Ukraine, "
"essential supplies are lacking, and there ar e access challenges for humanitarian "
assistance.  
"34. Some people, however, have remained in their homes. Older persons, in "
"particular, have remained, despite the danger, because they may have no place to go, "
"wish to protect their homes, may not want to bur den their families or may be "
prevented from leaving because of disabilities. Many of them are trapped on or near 
"the front lines and are isolated and in critical need of food, water, heating and medical "
and mental health support. Their difficulties will be  exacerbated in the winter.  
35. The ongoing hostilities have hampered people’s enjoyment of their human rights 
and fundamental freedoms. Countless allegations of violations and abuses of human 
rights and international humanitarian law and related crimes ha ve been reported. On 
"28 February 2022, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court opened an "
"investigation into allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.9 "
Numerous other international and national entities have initiated inve stigations of 
allegations of crimes committed in Ukraine.  
 
 
 IV . Violations of international law  
 
 
"36. The Commission has thus far carried out investigations in the provinces of Kyiv, "
"Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy and has focused on the events in February an d March "
"2022, as specified in Human Rights Council resolution S-34/1 . The Commission has "
"concentrated on behaviour  during the conduct of hostilities, including the use of "
"explosive weapons and the dest ruction of hospitals and schools, and on violations of "
"personal integrity, including executions, torture and ill -treatment, unlawful "
"confinement, and sexual and gender -based violence. It has also investigated violations "
affecting children.  
"37. During its i nquiry, the Commission established that human rights and "
"international humanitarian law violations, as well as related crimes, have been "
committed in all provinces on which it has focused thus far.  
 
 
 A.  Conduct of hostilities  
 
 
 1. Overview  
 
38. The Commission found that violations of human rights and international 
humanitarian law and war crimes had been committed during the conduct of 
hostilities. The Commission documented the indiscriminate use of explosive weapons 
in populated areas that were unde r attack by Russian armed forces. The Commission 
also found that Russian armed forces attacked civilians attempting to flee. There were 
"also examples of both parties to the armed conflict, although to different degrees, "
"failing to protect civilians or civi lian objects against the effects of attacks, by locating "
military objects and forces within or near densely populated areas.

 A/77/533  
 
9/20 22-23590  
  2. Impact of explosive weapons on civilian areas  
 
"39. According to OHCHR, the use of explosive weapons with wide -area effects in "
"populated areas caused 1,495 deaths and injuries in the four provinces during the "
"period under review, which represents 70 per cent of the civilians killed and injured "
in those areas. The actual numbers are likely to be higher. The Commission has 
independe ntly investigated attacks with explosive weapons. Such attacks had vast 
"consequences in the provinces of its focus, for instance in the cities of Chernihiv, "
"Sumy and Kharkiv, and impacted all segments of the population.  "
40. Attacks with explosive weapons had a devastating effect on buildings and 
"infrastructure. Thousands of residential buildings, schools, hospitals and facilities "
hosting essential infrastructure in the four provinces have been damaged or destroyed. 
The Commission observed first -hand the ex tent of the damage in all 27 settlements it 
"visited. In Chernihiv, the Commission saw dozens of houses and other buildings that "
had been destroyed or damaged during the attempt by Russian armed forces to take 
"the city. In Kharkiv, explosive weapons devasta ted entire areas of the city.  "
"41. Fighting and attacks affected a significant number of hospitals, which generally "
have protected status under international humanitarian law. The Commission 
"documented damage to or destruction of five hospitals, three in Ch ernihiv, one in "
Sumy and one in Kharkiv. Four of the hospitals were operating when they were hit by 
"explosive weapons. Three were severely or completely damaged, which impacted "
access by the civilian population to health services.10  
42. The Commission als o documented attacks with explosive weapons that affected 
"educational institutions. It visited seven such institutions, where it observed the "
damage first -hand.  
43. The extensive use of explosive weapons has caused immediate and long -lasting 
"trauma and da mage and has severely disrupted people’s lives, forcing them to flee or "
"live in fear. One older woman, who fled as hostilities raged in the Kharkiv area, told "
"the Commission: “I don’t live, I just exist; I have nothing left in my soul”.  "
 
 3. Indiscriminate attacks with explosive weapons  
 
44. The Commission has concluded that several attacks with explosive weapons that 
it investigated were indiscriminate and that feasible precautions to reduce civilian 
"harm were not taken, in violation of inter national humanitarian law. Indiscriminate "
attacks are those which are not directed at a specific military objective or employ a 
method or means of combat which cannot be directed at a specific military objective 
"or the effects of which cannot be limited, a s required by international humanitarian "
law.  
45. Such attacks are particularly challenging to investigate and to attribute to a 
"perpetrator, according to the Commission’s standard of proof, because they occur in "
"the context of fluid and rapidly evolving situations, and the parties to the armed "
conflict use similar weapon systems. The Commission’s investigations are ongoing. 
The evidence obtained thus far strongly suggests that the Russian armed forces have 
committed indiscriminate attacks.  
46. The indiscr iminate attacks documented thus far took place in areas controlled 
by the Ukrainian armed forces during attempts by the Russian armed forces to capture 
"those areas. In the city of Chernihiv, for example, when Russian armed forces "
__________________  
" 10  The five hospitals  were: Trostianets Hospital, Chernihiv Regional Children’s Hospital, Chernihiv "
"Central District Hospital, Izium Hospital and Chernihiv Cardiology Dispensary.  The latter three "
were damaged severely or completely and all were operating at the time of attack except the 
"Chernihiv District Hospital, although there were still some patients there.  "
A/77/533   
 
22-23590  10/20 
" surrounded the city betwee n 25 February11  and 31 March 2022, multiple "
"indiscriminate attacks with the use of explosive weapons occurred. In Sumy, attacks "
occurred in the context of repeated attempts by Russian armed forces to seize the city 
through ground battles and airstrikes.  
"47. In reaching the conclusion that the attacks were indiscriminate, the Commission "
has taken into account the potential existence of military objectives. In some of the 
"cases, the Commission collected credible information about the presence of Ukrainian "
"armed forces, which might have been the intended target of the attack, at or near the "
"impact locations. Nevertheless, the type and number of munitions used in the attacks "
"impacted civilians and civilian objects in a wider area, beyond the apparent military "
objective. They therefore constituted indiscriminate attacks.  
48. The Commission documented indiscriminate attacks with the use of cluster 
"munitions, which affect a large area and are therefore indiscriminate when used in "
"populated areas. For instance, in t he city of Chernihiv, on 17 March 2022, an attack "
with cluster munitions struck the Chernihiv Regional Children’s Hospital at a time 
when some of the victims were queuing for water on the premises of the hospital. It 
"killed several civilians and injured do zens, including four children.  "
49. The Commission documented indiscriminate attacks with the use of unguided 
"rockets, which cannot be precisely targeted, affect a large area when fired in salvos "
"and are therefore indiscriminate when used in populated area s. On 16 March 2022, "
"several munitions, including unguided rockets, struck an area in Chernihiv where "
more than 200 civilians were queuing for bread near a supermarket and killed at least 
14 civilians and injured 26.12  
"50. Significant civilian harm, both in terms of casualties and damage to buildings "
"and infrastructure, resulted from indiscriminate airstrikes using multiple unguided "
"bombs in populated areas. On 3 March 2022, an airplane dropped several unguided "
bombs on a residential area near the intersec tion of Chornovola and Kruhova streets 
"in the city of Chernihiv, killing at least 14 civilians and injuring dozens. The "
"Commission saw large craters and destruction, indicating that at least six munitions "
"struck within an area of about 130 metres, causing significant damage to the "
"infrastructure. Around the same time, also in Chernihiv, an airplane dropped several "
"unguided bombs in the Podusivka district, about 2 kilometres east of the first attack, "
"killing at least six civilians, including one child. The i mpact of the attack spanned "
"over 500 metres and affected a large area, which included two schools and residential "
"buildings. In both cases, the Commission identified potential military objectives in "
"the vicinity, which might have been the intended target. However, the area impacted "
was much larger and the attacks were therefore indiscriminate.  
"51. On 7 March 2022, in the city of Sumy, an airstrike dropped at least two bombs "
"on a residential area, killing at least 15 civilians and injuring 6. The Commission saw "
"two impact sites, where six houses were entirely destroyed. Other residential "
buildings were significantly damaged in a radius of more than 100 meters from where 
the bombs landed. The only potential military objective identified in the vicinity was 
"a mobilization office, which, according to residents, was not in use at that time.  "
 
__________________  
" 11  TASS, 25 February 2022, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation announced that units "
of the Russian armed forces had “completed the blockade of Chernihiv”.  
" 12  When various credible sources reported different casualty figures, the Commission chose the "
"reasonable minimum figures that were confirmed, but acknowledges that in many cases the "
figures are likely to be higher.  
 A/77/533  
 
11/20 22-23590  
  4. Endangering civilians  
 
"52. The Commission has found that, in several cases, Russian armed forces appear "
to have deliberately positioned their troops or equipment in residential areas or near 
civilians to reduce the likelihood of attacks. Russian armed forces also forced 
"civilians to  remain inside or in the proximity of their positions, exposing them to "
significant risk.  
"53. In the village of Kozarovychi, in Kyiv Province, an old woman reported that "
"when Russian armed forces arrived in late February, soldiers came to her house with "
orders to find hiding places for their vehicles. The woman and other local residents 
told the Commission that Russian armed forces placed military vehicles between 
"residential houses, in backyards and in garages and shot at Ukrainian positions from "
"between the houses. In the village of Lypivka, in Kyiv Province, a woman and her "
"daughter said that when Russian armed forces occupied the area on 28 February, "
soldiers parked one military vehicle identified as a tank next to their house while the 
woman and her da ughter hid in the basement.  
"54. Russian armed forces used a similar tactic in March 2022, in the village of "
"Yahidne, in Chernihiv Province, where they placed military vehicles between houses "
"and fired at Ukrainian positions from people’s backyards. In add ition, the soldiers "
"confined 365 civilians in the basement of a school, while they established their "
headquarters on the ground floor of the same building. Russian armed forces launched 
"attacks on Ukrainian positions from the grounds of the school, placing  hundreds of "
civilians confined in the building at significant risk (see paras. 78 and 79 below).  
55. The Commission also documented that in areas controlled by Ukrainian armed 
"forces, particularly during the first phase of the hostilities, on some occasi ons, there "
"was a lack of separation between armed forces and civilians, which placed civilians "
"at risk. In the city of Chernihiv, residents stated that, although  schools 18 and 21 were "
used to distribute humanitarian aid to the civilian population and school staff had 
"written “children” on the walls of one of the school buildings, Territorial Defence "
Forces of the Ukrainian armed forces had set up headquarters in school 18 and their 
members were also present at school 21. Both military pe rsonnel and civilians were 
among those killed and injured when an airstrike hit both schools and nearby houses 
"on 3 March 2022. By not separating civilians from their personnel, the Ukrainian "
armed forces in this case failed to protect civilians under thei r control from the effects 
of attacks.  
 
 5. Attacks on civilians  
 
56. The Commission found numerous cases in which Russian armed forces shot at 
"civilians trying to flee to safety and obtain food or other necessities, which resulted "
"in the killing or injury  of the victims. In the cases documented, the victims wore "
"civilian clothes, drove civilian cars and were unarmed. Most of the incidents took "
"place during daylight, which means that their civilian appearance should have been "
"clear to the attacker. Under in ternational humanitarian law, in case of  doubt, a person "
shall be considered to be a civilian. Attacks intentionally targeting civilians are war 
crimes.  
57. Several of the attacks took place as civilians came across Russian military 
"convoys that were on th e move. Soldiers shot civilians using assault rifles or, in some "
"cases, vehicle -mounted weapons. Those attacks show disregard for the requirement "
under international humanitarian law to verify that targets are neither civilians nor 
"civilian objects. In som e cases, these were deliberate.  "
"58. Several incidents took place along the E40 highway in Kyiv Province, also "
"referred to as the Zhytomyr highway, as Russian armed forces established control "
A/77/533   
 
22-23590  12/20 
" over sections of it in late February and March 2022. On 28 Februa ry 2022, around "
"noon, soldiers in a military convoy on the highway opened fire at four civilians who "
were attempting to flee through the fields. One woman was injured in the leg. On 
"1 March 2022, at approximately 10 a.m., soldiers opened fire on a civilian  car near "
"Kopyliv. The couple in the car, both in their sixties, managed to escape uninjured. On "
"3 March 2022, also around 10 a.m., a married couple and their two children came "
under attack near the village of Motyzhyn. The two adults died in the attack. A  9-year-
"old girl survived, while her sister, aged 15, was wounded and is still missing. Other "
"organizations have documented additional similar incidents in the same area, "
demonstrating that these cases were not isolated.  
59. The Commission has received rep orts of  such incidents in multiple locations in 
"all four provinces  covered in the present report , suggesting a clear pattern. For "
"example, a Russian military convoy attacked a civilian car in the village of "
"Shevchenkove, in Kyiv Province, killing two civil ians, one man and one woman, on "
"8 March. A military convoy opened fire on a civilian car near the village of Vyrivka, "
"in Sumy Province, on 27 February, killing a man and injuring his adult son. Soldiers "
of the Russian armed forces allegedly shot at two civ ilian cars as people were trying 
"to leave in the village of Stepanky, in Kharkiv Province, on 27  March, killing a "
woman and a girl. One of the cars was marked with a sign saying “children”.  
 
 
 B.  Violations against personal integrity  
 
 
 1. Overview  
 
60. Violations of human rights and international humanitarian law against people’s 
personal integrity have been committed in towns and settlements that Russian armed 
"forces occupied in the four provinces. These violations included summary executi ons, "
"torture, ill -treatment, sexual and gender -based violence, unlawful confinement and "
"detention in inhumane conditions, and forced deportations. Such acts also amount to "
war crimes.  
"61. The Commission also found two cases in which Ukrainian armed forces  shot, "
"wounded and tortured persons hors de combat, which are war crimes. While few in "
"numbers, such cases will continue to be the object of the Commission’s attention.  "
62. Residents of the localities visited told the Commission that in late February or 
"early March 2022, Russian armed forces arrived in their settlements and often "
"deployed in local schools, administration buildings or residential houses. In most "
"places, soldiers went door to door in search for “nazis” or “banderovtsy”, which are "
derogatory t erms often used by officials of the Russian Federation to describe 
"supporters of the Government of Ukraine. In many cases, they confiscated people’s "
phones.  
"63. In the places that Russian armed forces had occupied, local residents described "
"widespread loot ing and, at times, wanton destruction. Residents spoke of soldiers "
"stealing food and alcohol, personal belongings, valuables, computers and household "
"items, such as washing machines and microwaves, from stores and houses. Soldiers "
frequently seemed under t he influence of alcohol or intoxicated.  
"64. According to the interviewed interlocutors, the behaviour of soldiers of the "
Russian armed forces differed. The Commission has also received reports that some 
"Russian armed forces servicemen helped people escape from captivity, interfered with "
attempts of others to commit sexual violence or provided medical assistance to people 
injured by attacks.  
 
 A/77/533  
 
13/20 22-23590  
  2. Summary executions  
 
"65. Investigations in the provinces of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy reveal a "
pattern of summary executions in areas temporarily occupied by Russian armed forces 
"in February and March 2022, which are violations of the right to life and war crimes.  "
"66. Many summary executions occurred in Bucha, in Kyiv Province. Local and "
international organiz ations and media outlets have gathered and published extensive 
documentation on the events in Bucha. The Commission interviewed a local official 
who was among the first on the scene after Russian armed forces withdrew. He told 
the Commission that he saw ei ght dead bodies in the backyard of the house where the 
soldiers had established their base. Some of them had their hands tied behind their 
backs and presented signs of torture. He also saw more than 10 dead bodies of 
"civilians lying on the street. In anoth er incident, five bodies were found in a basement, "
with their hands behind their backs and gunshot wounds. A woman confirmed that her 
adult son was among the five bodies.  
67. Summary executions took place in numerous other localities. The Commission 
is inv estigating credible allegations of similar executions in 16 other towns and 
"settlements, involving 49 victims. The majority are men of fighting age, but the total "
includes two women and one 14 -year-old boy. The cases are located in all four 
"provinces under  the Commission’s initial focus, suggesting a wide geographical "
pattern.  
68. The summary executions verified by the Commission occurred in places where 
"Russian armed forces took positions for an extended period of time, close to the front "
"lines. This was the case in settlements situated north of Kyiv, where Russian armed "
"forces were forced to halt their advance; to the south of Chernihiv, while Russian "
armed forces were launching offensives to capture the city; and close to the separation 
line between Russ ian armed forces and Ukrainian armed forces in Sumy Province. At 
"the time of writing of the present report, the Commission had not been able to access "
certain areas of Kharkiv Province because of the continuing precariousness of the 
security situation.  
"69. In the cases that the Commission investigated, several elements, often in "
"combination, indicated that the victims were executed. A common element was that "
victims were last seen in the custody or the presence of Russian armed forces. The 
bodies of the vic tims were exhumed from separate or mass graves or recovered from 
houses or basements that the Russian armed forces had occupied. Some victims’ dead 
"bodies were found with hands tied behind their back, a clear indication that the victim "
was in custody and p osed no threat at the time of death.   
"70. According to witnesses and survivors, some of the perpetrators accused the "
"victims of transmitting information to Ukrainian armed forces, of collaborating with "
the Ukrainian armed forces or of other contributions to the fighting against Russian 
"armed forces. In a case documented in the village of Vyshneve, in Chernihiv Province, "
"which was occupied by Russian armed forces from 28 February to 4 April 2022, "
"witnesses reported that, on 18 March 2022, as t hey searched for individuals behind "
"an attack on one of their convoys, Russian armed forces arrested three adult brothers. "
"They tied the victims’ hands behind their backs, blindfolded them and beat them "
"severely for three days, after which they shot and bu ried them in a shallow grave. "
Two of the brothers died and the third was injured but survived.  
71. The Commission’s investigations show that the cause of death of the victims is 
consistent with methods typically used during executions: gunshot wounds to th e 
"heads, blunt trauma or slit throats. In some cases, there was also evidence of torture "
"on the bodies, such as bruises, wounds and fractures (see paras. 81 –85 below).  "
A/77/533   
 
22-23590  14/20 
" 72. A case that illustrates several of these patterns, is the killing of six men in the  "
"village of Staryi Bykiv, in Chernihiv Province. Witnesses detailed how Russian armed "
"forces apprehended several local residents on 27 February 2022, the day they took "
"control of the village, as they were searching for people who had operated a drone "
that killed one of their soldiers. The perpetrators took the men to their base. Relatives 
heard screams and gunshots from where the soldiers had detained the victims. The 
"next day, they saw the bodies of six men lying on the street where the incident took "
"place , but were not permitted to access the location until nine days later, when Russian "
armed forces finally allowed them to pick up the bodies. The bodies had multiple 
"gunshot wounds, stab wounds and broken ribs, and one had a slit throat.  "
73. While summary e xecutions were mainly perpetrated following unlawful 
"detention, the Commission also documented cases in which victims were executed in "
"public places as others were watching. In the village of Vesele, in Kharkiv Province, "
two witnesses reported that soldier s of the Russian armed forces beat and shot dead a 
person whom they dragged off a bus that was transporting people to the Russian 
"Federation. After the execution, the perpetrators told the other passengers that the "
victim had been shot and killed because h e had been transmitting information to the 
Ukrainian armed forces.  
74. The violent loss of a close family member has a profound effect on the survivors. 
"Families described the trauma, anguish and anger they felt as a consequence of such "
events. The mother  of a man executed in Kyiv Province  stated: “I still wake up at 
"night, stand in the dark and scream, call for my son and cry out of pain”.  "
 
" 3.  Unlawful confinement, inhumane treatment and forcible transfers  "
 
"75. In late February and March 2022, Russian a rmed forces unlawfully confined "
"large numbers of civilians in areas which they controlled, which is a violation of the "
"right to liberty and a war crime. Victims included local authorities, Government "
"personnel, veterans of the Ukrainian armed forces, volun teers evacuating civilians "
and civilians who seem to have been randomly arrested. While the majority were 
"young or middle -aged men, women, children and older persons were also confined. "
"In several cases, perpetrators searched the houses and the phones of t he victims.  "
76. Russian armed forces detained individuals in makeshift facilities established in 
"buildings they had occupied, such as the basement of a school, an industrial facility, "
"an agricultural facility, a train station, an airport and various dwelli ngs. Victims were "
often not informed of the reasons behind their detention and these acts were not 
reviewed by a judicial authority. Their families were not informed of their 
whereabouts and some are still reported missing.  
"77. In the majority of cases, t he detention took place under conditions so severe that "
"the confinement amounted to inhuman conditions, which is a violation of the right to "
be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person 
during deprivation of libert y and a war crime. Detention was frequently prolonged 
"and facilities were cramped and overcrowded, at times with dozens of people forced "
"to share a small space and to sleep on the floor. Men, women and children were held "
"together in the same space. There w as a lack of light, ventilation and heating during "
the freezing March temperatures. Some were confined in a metal cellar. Access to 
"food, water and medical care was limited, and sanitary conditions were lacking. "
"Unlawful confinement was often the precursor  to execution, sexual violence, torture "
and ill -treatment.  
"78. In the village of Yahidne, in Chernihiv Province, soldiers of the Russian armed "
"forces  confined 365 civilians, including 70 children, for 28 days in the basement of a "
"local school, where they had established their position in March 2022. Victims "
reported that soldiers threatened to shoot them if they did not assemble in the 
 A/77/533  
 
15/20 22-23590  
 basement. Soldiers demanded that residents hand in all their phones. The conditions 
"of detention were inhumane. According to the victims, the space was so crowded that "
some were forced to stand or sleep on chairs for weeks. There was no light or 
"ventilation, and the air was hot and suffocating. Water was dripping from ceilings and "
walls and there were no showers or toilets.  
79. The soldiers degraded and violated the dignity of the detainees. There was very 
"limited access to food and water, and close to no access to medical care. The victims "
"had to seek permission to exit the premises or to use the toilet, which was only given  "
"sporadically. In the yard, the soldiers randomly shot near the victims to scare them. "
"Ten older persons died during the confinement as a result of the inhumane conditions, "
and others developed health problems. The Commission visited the basement and saw 
the writings of the confined victims on the wall listing the names of those who had 
died.  
"80. In some of the cases documented by the Commission, after initial detention in "
"Ukraine, individuals were forcibly transferred and unlawfully deported through "
"Belaru s, or directly, to the Russian Federation, which is a violation of international "
"humanitarian law. In the Russian Federation, victims were further held in detention "
"facilities. Some victims stated that during their transit in Belarus, Russian armed "
forces registered them and provided them with Russian Federation identity cards. 
Witnesses reported seeing dozens of Ukrainian detainees in detention facilities in the 
Russian Federation. Many people are still missing from the areas that were under the 
"occupation  of Russian armed forces. For example, the Commission received from "
local residents in Dymer a list of 58 people still missing in Kyiv Province. Many of 
them were last seen in the custody of Russian armed forces. While relatives have 
"received confirmation that some of them are in detention in the Russian Federation, "
the fate of many is still unknown.  
 
" 4.  Torture, ill -treatment and wounding of protected persons  "
 
81. The Commission has documented many cases of torture and ill -treatment 
"committed by Russian armed forces, which is a violation of the prohibition against "
"torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and a war "
"crime. Perpetrators targeted local authorities or employees of the local administration, "
veterans of the Ukrainian  armed forces and volunteers helping Ukrainian armed 
forces. They also targeted individuals evacuating civilians. Torture and ill -treatment 
occurred during unlawful confinement in detention facilities in Ukraine and in the 
"Russian Federation. The victims w ere mostly men, but included women as well.  "
"82. According to victims, Russian armed forces carried out long interrogation "
"sessions, sometimes lasting for days, which were combined with threats, intimidation, "
"ill-treatment, sexual violence and torture. The se were aimed at extracting information "
"about the Ukrainian armed forces and their positions and local resistance groups, or "
to identify collaborators with Ukrainian armed forces. Perpetrators also accused 
victims of sharing information with Ukrainian arme d forces and committing attacks 
and sabotage against Russian armed forces. Victims reported that soldiers called the 
victims “fascists” and “livestock”.  
83. Russian armed forces inflicted severe physical and mental pain and suffering 
upon the victims durin g detention in Ukraine. Some of the treatments administered 
"included tying of hands or handcuffing, tying of legs, blindfolding with cloth, tape or "
"bags placed on heads, severe and prolonged beatings with rifle butts or batons, electric "
"shocks with tasers,  threats of execution or mock executions and prolonged exposure "
"to cold. In some cases, victims were executed after torture (see paras. 69 –72 above). "
One of the victims who had been detained and tortured by Russian armed forces in 
"Kyiv Province  told the Co mmission that throughout the detention, during which "
A/77/533   
 
22-23590  16/20 
" torture was continuous, it was as if the “body shut down and switched to a survival "
mode”. Victims also described acts of forced nudity for prolonged periods in front of 
"others, which amount to sexual vi olence.  "
"84. After transfer to and detention in the Russian Federation, victims described how "
"they were stripped naked again, were forced to stand naked in front of others for "
"hours, or had hands and feet tied, and underwent long beating sessions. One victi m "
was severely beaten for two days after refusing to declare support for the Russian 
Federation on camera. Another victim was forced to stand naked and shout “glory to 
"Russia” while being beaten, and described beatings as “punishment for speaking "
Ukrainian ” and “not remembering the lyrics of the anthem of the Russian Federation”.  
"85. Survivors sustained short -term and long -term injuries and trauma, such as "
"broken facial bones, ribs, knees and fingers, bruises or injuries leading to the inability "
to walk.  
86. The Commission has also documented two cases in which Ukrainian armed 
"forces shot, wounded and tortured captured soldiers of the Russian armed forces, "
"which are war crimes. Upon their capture, these soldiers acquired prisoner -of-war "
status and were pro tected under international humanitarian law. The Office of the 
General Prosecutor of Ukraine informed the Commission that his office had opened 
criminal proceedings regarding both cases.  
"87. In the first case, in Mala Rohan, in Kharkiv Province, between 24 and 26 March "
"2022, soldiers of the Ukrainian armed forces deliberately shot three captured soldiers "
of the Russian armed forces in the legs at close range and beat one of them with a 
"rifle butt, while interrogating them. In the second case, near  Dmytrivka, in Kyiv "
"Province, around 29 March 2022, a soldier of the Ukrainian armed forces shot three "
times at close range and wounded an already wounded soldier of the Russian armed 
"forces. A video shows other motionless soldiers of the Russian armed for ces nearby, "
"including one with his hands tied behind his back and an apparent wound to his head, "
suggesting that he had likely been executed.  
 
 5. Sexual and gender -based violence  
 
88. The Commission investigated cases of rape committed by some soldiers o f the 
Russian armed forces during the period under review in localities that came under 
"their control, which are war crimes. Victims ranged from 4 to over 80 years old. "
Perpetrators raped the women and girls in their homes or took them and raped them 
"in un occupied dwellings. In most cases, these acts also amount to torture and cruel or "
inhumane treatment for the victims and for relatives who were forced to watch. Other 
"incidents of sexual violence were also documented against women, men and girls. "
The Commi ssion continues to investigate the extent to which sexual and gender -based 
violence constituted a widespread pattern.  
89. Cases relating to sexual and gender -based violence are challenging to 
investigate. Victims face obstacles in reporting such violation s. Because of the current 
"security situation and forced displacement, victims have difficulties accessing "
"appropriate health care, psychological support services and law enforcement offices "
"in a timely fashion. Furthermore, it is not always possible to doc ument forensically "
the existence of rape and the full extent of the victims’ trauma. Autopsy reports often 
focus on the immediate cause of death rather than the entirety of the trauma sustained 
"by the victims because of a lack of resources, families’ reque sts that the post -mortem "
examination not be carried out or the condition of the remains.  
"90. In Kyiv Province, in March 2022, two Russian soldiers entered a home, raped a "
"22-year-old woman several times, committed acts of sexual violence on her husband "
and forced the couple to have sexual intercourse in their presence. Then one of the 
 A/77/533  
 
17/20 22-23590  
" soldiers forced their 4 -year-old daughter to perform oral sex on him, which is rape. "
The Commission is currently investigating three other credible allegations of Russian 
"arme d forces raping women and teenage girls in the same village. In another village, "
Russian armed forces took a woman out of her house and forced her to go to a 
"neighbouring house, where one of the soldiers of the Russian armed forces had shot "
dead a man who had tried to defend his wife. Two soldiers took both women to another 
house that served as their base. The soldiers proceeded to different rooms to rape and 
sexually assault the two women.  
"91. In another village in Kyiv Province , at the beginning of March 2022, a soldier "
of the Russian armed forces entered the house of a 50 -year-old woman. After shooting 
"her husband, who tried to interfere, he took the woman to a nearby empty house where "
he raped her until another Russian armed f orces military unit arrived and took him 
"away. Her husband died of his injuries two days later, as he could not be taken to the "
hospital. The Commission is investigating another case of alleged sexual violence in 
the same time period in the same neighbourh ood.  
"92. In a nearby village, at the beginning of March 2022, two Russian armed forces "
servicemen repeatedly raped a 33 -year-old woman after killing her husband. One of 
"the alleged perpetrators has been identified, and criminal proceedings have been "
initiated in absentia against him. The Commission is investigating another incident 
that occurred later that month in the same village. A 56 -year-old woman explained 
how two of the three Russian armed forces servicemen who broke into her home gang -
raped her as the third one watched while masturbating. They stole food and money 
"from her. She learned a couple of weeks later that, in a separate incident, her husband "
had been tortured and executed.  
"93. In Chernihiv Province and another province, the Commission has b een "
investigating two cases of rape of women over 80 years old. An 83 -year-old woman 
"described how, while her village was occupied by Russian armed forces, she was "
"raped by a Russian armed forces serviceman in her house, where her physically "
"disabled husba nd was also present. In another instance, neighbours found the body of "
"an older woman, partially undressed and with blood around her vagina. At the request "
"of the family, the authorities did not perform a full autopsy.  "
"94. Also in Chernihiv Province, in M arch 2022, Russian armed forces occupied a "
home for more than a week. The unit commander repeatedly sexually abused a 
16-year-old girl during that time and threatened to kill other family members who 
tried to protect her. Two of the Russian armed forces se rvicemen were subsequently 
identified.  
"95. There was also an instance in Chernihiv Province, in March 2022, in which a "
"Russian armed forces serviceman broke into a house, threatened the inhabitants with "
his weapon and attempted to rape a woman in front of her 3 -year-old son. The 
"neighbours, alerted by the noise, ran to the house, while others went to alert his "
commander.  
"96. In Kharkiv Province, the Commission is investigating two cases of repeated rape "
"of an adolescent girl over a three -month period,  allegedly by a soldier of the Russian "
"armed forces, and repeated rape, reportedly by a Russian armed forces serviceman, "
of a 31 -year-old woman who was taking shelter in a school basement.  
"97. In several incidents documented by the Commission, Russian armed forc es "
"committed sexual violence against men and women under their custody, often "
resorting to forced nudity in a coercive and humiliating environment.  
98. Survivors and their families remain deeply traumatized by the ordeal they 
endured. One victim told the Commission “this experience is very shameful for me 
"and I am extremely scared and intimidated”. In addition, the stigma that continues to "
A/77/533   
 
22-23590  18/20 
 surround sexual violence requires patience until victims feel safe enough and 
adequately cared for to speak out about what happened. Some victims refuse to speak. 
Some have considered suicide. One psychologist working with survivors said that “all 
victims with whom I am working are blaming themselves for being spotted by 
perpetrators and being raped”.  
 
 
 C.  Impact on chi ldren  
 
 
99. The events of late February and March 2022 in the four provinces had a 
devastating and continuing impact on children’s rights and lives. Children of all ages 
"were killed or wounded in their homes, shelters, streets and playgrounds. OHCHR "
"has ve rified the deaths of 112 children, including 36 girls, 62 boys and 14 whose sex "
"could not be determined, in the four provinces during the period under review.  "
100.  Many children died as a consequence of attacks with explosive weapons in 
populated areas (s ee paras. 44 –51 above). The Commission investigated attacks in 
"which children were victims. On 25 February 2022, in the town of Okhtyrka, in Sumy "
"Province, for example, two attacks with explosive weapons killed a 7 -year-old girl "
"and injured an 8 -year-old b oy. On 7 March 2022, in the city of Sumy, an attack killed "
"four children between the ages of 6 and 16. In the city of Chernihiv, several airstrikes "
killed one boy and injured seven children on 3 March 2022.  
101.  The Commission documented cases in which violations of the personal integrity 
"of children had been committed. In one case, a 14 -year-old boy was found dead "
together with his neighbour. Both had injuries to their heads consistent with gunshot 
"wounds, suggesting that they were executed (see p aras. 67 –71 above).  "
"102.  Moreover, the Commission has found that Russian armed forces unlawfully "
"confined children in inhumane conditions. In one case, 70 children were among 365 "
civilians confined for 28 days by Russian armed forces in the basement of a s chool in 
"Yahidne, in Chernihiv Province, where the soldiers had established their base (see "
paras. 78 and 79 above). Some children fell sick and had no access to medication. The 
youngest child was only six weeks old.  
103.  The Commission confirmed cases of sexual violence in which Russian armed 
"forces raped girls when entering or occupying civilian homes. Further, a 4 -year-old "
girl could hear her mother screaming while she was raped in the adjacent room. Such 
acts also amount to torture.  
104.  The hostilitie s have had a significant impact on children’s right to education. 
Attacks with explosive weapons have damaged or destroyed hundreds of schools and 
"kindergartens in the four provinces, according to the Ukrainian authorities. The "
Commission independently doc umented damage to seven such institutions (see 
"para.  42 above). Airstrikes on Chernihiv on 3 March 2022, for example, severely "
"damaged schools 18 and 21, where more than 1,200 pupils had studied previously.  "
105.  One reason for the extensive damage and dest ruction to schools is that both the 
Russian armed forces and the Ukrainian armed forces used some of the schools for 
military purposes.13  The Commission documented one case in which a school in 
Kharkiv Province was first occupied by Russian armed forces an d then subsequently 
by Ukrainian forces. While international law does not prohibit military forces from 
"using schools, the presence of military personnel on school premises and their "
utilization for military purposes puts schools at risk of being attacked as military 
objectives.  
__________________  
" 13  For example, schools 18 and 21 in Chernihiv.  "
 A/77/533  
 
19/20 22-23590  
 106.  The Commission has also examined cases of wanton damage to schools and 
"school equipment. The headmaster of lycée 1 in Hostomel, in Kyiv Province , told the "
Commission that the Russian armed forces that had occupied the village h ad 
"destroyed more than 250 computers, furniture and virtually all of the windows and "
"doors in the school, and had shared photos of the destruction.  "
"107.  The combined effects of the damage and destruction of educational institutions, "
the massive displacemen t of pupils and teachers and the fact that a large number of 
"schools do not meet the mandated school safety requirements, including adequate "
"bomb shelters, mean that a large number of Ukrainian children had to attend classes "
online when the school year sta rted. Although the Ukrainian authorities have 
"developed extensive content for remote schooling, many children, especially in rural "
"areas, do not have access to the equipment, electricity or mobile and internet "
"connectivity that would allow them to attend c lasses remotely, and their right to "
education is therefore compromised.  
"108.  The war forced thousands of children to flee, uprooted them from their daily life "
"and, in many cases, separated them from their fathers, who either joined the fighting "
or could no t leave with their families. Those who stayed were exposed to explosions 
"and air raid sirens, and many witnessed traumatic events, including the killing or "
"maiming of parents and loved ones. Parents, family members and aid workers "
described how all these f actors had had a deep psychological effect on children. Some 
"are afraid of loud noises, of being alone and of men, particularly men in uniform. "
Parents also described how their children had difficulty sleeping and experienced 
nightmares. After an attack wi th explosive weapons in a residential area of Kharkiv a 
"mother described how the attack had impacted her daughter, saying “she is very "
traumatized and will only sleep in the corridor; she also goes to the corridor every 
time she hears sirens during the day time and starts to shake”.  
 
 
 V .  Concluding observations  
 
 
"109.  Based on its investigations of the events in Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy "
"in late February and March 2022, the Commission has found reasonable grounds to "
conclude that an array of war cr imes and violations of human rights and international 
humanitarian law have been committed in Ukraine since 24 February 2022. As 
"detailed in the present report, Russian armed forces are responsible for the vast "
majority of the violations identified by the Commission. The Commission has also 
found instances in which Ukrainian armed forces have violated international 
"humanitarian law, including two situations in which they committed war crimes. "
"While few in number, such cases will continue to be the object of  the Commission’s "
attention.  
110. The impact of these violations on the people in Ukraine is immense.  The loss of 
"lives is in the thousands. The destruction of infrastructure, which includes the "
"destruction not only of physical objects, but also of what fa milies have built or "
"invested to ensure their comfort and safety in the future, has been immense. Some "
people whose homes have been damaged by explosive weapons have no choice but 
"to remain in their homes with makeshift walls and windows, as winter approac hes. "
"They have to cope with the consequences of the loss of friends, relatives and "
immediate family members and large -scale destruction.  
111. Family members who lost loved ones have expressed a strong need for justice 
to be done. A stepfather whose son was  killed in Bucha told the Commission: “I used 
"to want to find those who were responsible and kill them, but now I want the guilty "
to be put on trial and I want the truth to come out”.  
A/77/533   
 
22-23590  20/20 
" 112. In this connection, more than ever, sound coordination of the multi ple national "
and international accountability initiatives in Ukraine is key to guaranteeing strict 
adherence to the relevant standards for the collection of evidence and for its use in 
judicial processes that satisfy due process guarantees. The Commission expresses its 
hope that such coordination  will become more established.  
 
 
 VI. Next steps  
 
 
113. Having paid particular attention to violations committed in the four areas 
"specified in Human Rights Council resolution  S-34/1 , the Commission will gradually "
"devote more of its resources to the broader temporal, geographical and thematic "
framework set forth in Council resolution 49/1 . 
"114. The issues of in terest will include possible violations in filtration camps, alleged "
forced transfers of people and conditions under which expedited adoptions of children 
"are allegedly taking place, as well as changes in local administration and so -called "
"referendums, the  consequences of which are becoming clearer given recent events.  "
"115. The Commission will continue to act in a victim -centred way, which it interprets "
"not only in terms of doing no harm to victims, but also, and more positively, in terms "
of making recommendations concerning forms of accountability that supplement 
"criminal accountability, including measures of recognition, reparation, rehabilitation, "
"reconstruction and, importantly, guarantees of non -repetition.  "
